abstract = {Background: Artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper both, the visual interpretation by experts as well as the algorithmic processing and analysis (e.g. for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) or for Mental State Monitoring). While hand-optimized selection of source components derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to clean EEG data is widespread, the field could greatly profit from automated solutions based on Machine Learning methods. Existing ICA-based removal strategies depend on explicit recordings of an individual's artifacts or have not been shown to reliably identify muscle artifacts. Methods: We propose an automatic method for the classification of general artifactual source components. They are estimated by TDSEP, an ICA method that takes temporal correlations into account. The linear classifier is based on an optimized feature subset determined by a Linear Programming Machine (LPM). The subset is composed of features from the frequency-, the spatial- and temporal domain. A subject independent classifier was trained on 640 TDSEP components (reaction time (RT) study, n = 12) that were hand labeled by experts as artifactual or brain sources and tested on 1080 new components of RT data of the same study. Generalization was tested on new data from two studies (auditory Event Related Potential (ERP) paradigm, n = 18; motor imagery BCI paradigm, n = 80) that used data with different channel setups and from new subjects. Results: Based on six features only, the optimized linear classifier performed on level with the inter-expert disagreement ({\textless}10{\%} Mean Squared Error (MSE)) on the RT data. On data of the auditory ERP study, the same pre-calculated classifier generalized well and achieved 15{\%} MSE. On data of the motor imagery paradigm, we demonstrate that the discriminant information used for BCI is preserved when removing up to 60{\%} of the most artifactual source components. Conclusions: We propose a universal and efficient classifier of ICA components for the subject independent removal of artifacts from EEG data. Based on linear methods, it is applicable for different electrode placements and supports the introspection of results. Trained on expert ratings of large data sets, it is not restricted to the detection of eye- and muscle artifacts. Its performance and generalization ability is demonstrated on data of different EEG studies.},

abstract = {Wide innervation of cholinergic projections throughout the cortex implies that acetylcholine (ACh) plays an essential role in information processing, but how it works is still enigmatic. Experimental as well as theoretical work in the olfactory cortex and hippocampus suggests that ACh, via the muscarinic receptors, serves to shift the dynamics of the cortical networks into a state where afferent influence predominates over intracortical influence. Recent experiments in the visual and somatosensory cortex suggested that this hypothesis could be extended to neocortex. In addition, participation of the nicotinic receptors in regulating the synaptic response in the somatosensory cortex further substantiates this hypothesis. This hypothesis, derived mainly from in vitro work, also seemed to account for results from in vivo experiments without any obvious inconsistencies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Visual perception is based on information processing during periods of eye fixations that are interrupted by fast saccadic eye movements. The ability to sample and relate information on task-relevant objects across fixations implies that correspondence between presaccadic and postsaccadic objects is established. Postsaccadic object information usually updates and overwrites information on the corresponding presaccadic object. The presaccadic object representation is then lost. In contrast, the presaccadic object is conserved when object correspondence is broken. This helps transsaccadic memory but it may impose attentional costs on object recognition. Therefore, we investigated how breaking object correspondence across the saccade affects postsaccadic object recognition. In Experiment 1, object correspondence was broken by a brief postsaccadic blank screen. Observers made a saccade to a peripheral object which was displaced during the saccade. This object reappeared either immediately after the saccade or after the blank screen. Within the postsaccadic object, a letter was briefly presented (terminated by a mask). Observers reported displacement direction and letter identity in different blocks. Breaking object correspondence by blanking improved displacement identification but deteriorated postsaccadic letter recognition. In Experiment 2, object correspondence was broken by changing the object's contrast-polarity. There were no object displacements and observers only reported letter identity. Again, breaking object correspondence deteriorated postsaccadic letter recognition. These findings identify transsaccadic object correspondence as a key determinant of object recognition across the saccade. This is in line with the recent hypothesis that breaking object correspondence results in separate representations of presaccadic and postsaccadic objects which then compete for limited attentional processing resources (Schneider, 2013). Postsaccadic object recognition is then deteriorated because less resources are available for processing postsaccadic objects.},

abstract = {The intrinsic cholinergic innervation of the cortical microvessels contains both subcortical pathways and local cortical interneurons mediated by muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Stimulation of this system leads to vasodilatation. In the extrinsic innervation, choline acts as a selective agonist for the ??7-nicoticinic acetylcholine receptor on the sympathetic nerves to cause vasodilatation, and through this mechanism, cholinergic modulation may affect this sympathetic vasodilatation. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a cerebral cholinergic deficit and cerebral blood flow is diminished. Cholinesterase inhibitors, important drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, could influence the cerebral blood flow through stimulation of the intrinsic cholinergic cerebrovascular innervation. Indeed, cholinesterase inhibitors improve cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer patients who respond to treatment. Further, cerebrovascular reactivity and neurovascular coupling are impaired in Alzheimer's disease and both can be improved by cholinesterase inhibitors. Conversely, cholinesterase inhibitors inhibit the ??7-nicoticinic acetylcholine receptor on extrinsic sympathetic nerves and thus may impair vasodilatation. The net outcome of these opposing effects in clinical practice remains unknown. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the regulation of cerebral blood flow during blood pressure changes (cerebral autoregulation) is impaired in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Technological developments now allow us to dynamically measure blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral cortical oxygenation. Using simple maneuvers like single sit-stand and repeated sit-stand maneuvers, the regulation of cerebral perfusion in patients with Alzheimer's disease can easily be measured. Sit-stand maneuvers can be considered as a provocation test for cerebral autoregulation, and provide excellent opportunities to study the cerebrovascular effects of cholinesterase inhibitors. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31{\%} of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40{\%}. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40{\%}. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10{\%} of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

Since neuromodulators convey information about novelty or reward, the influence of neuromodulators on synaptic plasticity is useful not just for action learning in classical conditioning, but also to decide "when" to create new memories in response to a flow of sensory stimuli. In this review, we focus on timing requirements for pre- and postsynaptic activity in conjunction with one or several phasic neuromodulatory signals. While the emphasis of the text is on conceptual models and mathematical theories, we also discuss some experimental evidence for neuromodulation of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity. We highlight the importance of synaptic mechanisms in bridging the temporal gap between sensory stimulation and neuromodulatory signals, and develop a framework for a class of neo-Hebbian three-factor learning rules that depend on presynaptic activity, postsynaptic variables as well as the influence of neuromodulators.},

abstract = {Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain provide the major cholinergic innervation to the cortex and hippocampus, and play a key role in memory and attentional processes. Dysfunction of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) is a cardinal feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with cognitive decline. Survival of BFCN neurons depends upon binding of nerve growth factor (NGF), which is synthesized and secreted by cells in the cortex and hippocampus, with high-affinity (TrkA) and low-affinity (p75NTR) neurotrophin receptors produced within BFCN neurons. NGF released from target cells activates TrkA on axon terminals and triggers activation of PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK, and PLC?? (phospholipase C) signaling pathways. The signal then travels retrogradely along axon to cell body to promote neuronal survival. However, the nature of the retrograde signal remains mysterious. p75NTR receptors could mediate a fundamentally different signaling pathway leading to apoptic cell death. Dysfunction of NGF and its receptors has been suggested to underlie the selective degeneration of the BFCN in end stage Alzheimer disease. In this regard, NGF, the founding member of the neurotrophin family, has generated great interest as a potential target for the treatment of AD. This review focuses on NGF-cholinergic dependency, NGF/receptor binding, signal transduction, retrograde transport, regulation of specific cellular endpoints, and the potential involvement of cytoskeleton dysfunction in defected NGF signaling. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We have explored conditions for the existence of attractor states, critical relations between their parameters and the spectrum of single neuron models, which can implement the MMBANN. Besides, we describe functional models (perceptron and SOM), which obtain significant advantages over the traditional implementation of these models, while using MMBANN. In particular, a perceptron, based on MMBANN, gets specificity gain in orders of error probabilities values, MMBANN SOM obtains real neurophysiological meaning, the number of possible grandma cells increases 1000-fold with MMBANN. MMBANN have sets of attractor states, which can serve as finite grids for representation of variables in computations. These grids may show dimensions of d = 0, 1, 2,{\ldots}.

abstract = {Cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation play a key role in determining overall behavioral state by shaping the underlying cortical network dynamics. The effects of these systems on synaptic and intrinsic cellular targets are quite diverse and a comprehensive understanding of how these neuromodulators regulate (spontaneous) cortical network activity has remained elusive. Here, we used multielectrode electrophysiology in vitro to investigate the effect of these neuromodulators on spontaneous network dynamics in acute slices of mouse visual cortex. We found that application of Carbachol (CCh) and Norepinephrine (NE) both enhanced the spontaneous network dynamics by increasing (1) the activity levels, (2) the temporal complexity of the network activity, and (3) the spatial complexity by decorrelating the network activity over a wide range of neuromodulator concentrations (1 $\mu$M, 10 $\mu$M, 50 $\mu$M, and 100 $\mu$M). Interestingly, we found that cholinergic neuromodulation was limited to the presence of CCh in the bath whereas the effects of NE, in particular for higher concentrations, induced plasticity that caused outlasting effects most prominently in the deep cortical layers. Together, these results provide a comprehensive network-level understanding of the similarities and differences of cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation of spontaneous network dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli.

This revealed that in the primate visual system, feedforward influences are carried by theta-band ({\~{}}4Hz) and gamma-band ({\~{}}60-80Hz) synchronization, and feedback influences by beta-band ({\~{}}14-18Hz) synchronization.

abstract = {Neuromodulators including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and a range of peptides alter the processing characteristics of cortical networks through effects on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, on the adaptation of cortical pyramidal cells, on membrane potential, on the rate of synaptic modification, and on other cortical parameters. Computational models of self-organization and associative memory function in cortical structures such as the hippocampus, piriform cortex and neocortex provide a theoretical framework in which the role of these neuromodulatory effects can be analyzed. Neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine appear to enhance the influence of synapses from afferent fibers arising outside the cortex relative to the synapses of intrinsic and association fibers arising from other cortical pyramidal cells. This provides a continuum between a predominant influence of external stimulation to a predominant influence of internal recall (extrinsic vs. intrinsic). Modulatory influence along this continuum may underlie effects described in terms of learning and memory, signal to noise ratio, and attention. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The tools of weakly coupled phase oscillator theory have had a profound impact on the neuroscience community, providing insight into a variety of network behaviours ranging from central pattern generation to synchronisation, as well as predicting novel network states such as chimeras. However, there are many instances where this theory is expected to break down, say in the presence of strong coupling, or must be carefully interpreted, as in the presence of stochastic forcing. There are also surprises in the dynamical complexity of the attractors that can robustly appear—for example, heteroclinic network attractors. In this review we present a set of mathematical tools that are suitable for addressing the dynamics of oscillatory neural networks, broadening from a standard phase oscillator perspective to provide a practical framework for further successful applications of mathematics to understanding network dynamics in neuroscience.},

Here we outline the conceptual and practical advantages of an alternative analysis method: Bayesian hypothesis testing and model selection using the Bayes factor. In contrast to pNHST, Bayes factors allow researchers to quantify evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Also, Bayes factors do not require adjustment for the intention with which the data were collected. The use of Bayes factors is demonstrated through an extended example for hierarchical regression based on the design of an experiment recently published in the Journal of Management. This example also highlights the fact that p values overestimate the evidence against the null hypothesis, misleading researchers into believing that their findings are more reliable than is warranted by the data.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine from the basal forebrain and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from intracortical inhibitory interneurons exert strong influence on the cortical activity and may interact with each other. Cholinergic or muscarinic agonists indeed induced GABAergic postsynaptic currents in pyramidal cells by exciting inhibitory interneurons that have recently been classified into several distinct subtypes on the basis of the physiological, chemical, and morphological criteria. Cholinergic effects on GABAergic cell subtypes were investigated of rat frontal cortex by in vitro whole cell recording with intracellular staining in frontal cortex of young rats. GABAergic cell subtypes were identified physiologically by firing responses to depolarizing current pulses and immunohistochemically as containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), or cholecystokinin (CCK). Carbachol (10 microM) or (+)-muscarine (3 microM) affected the activities of peptide-containing GABAergic cells with regular- or burst-spiking characteristics, but not of GABAergic cells with fast-spiking characteristics containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin or GABAergic cells with late-spiking characteristics. Somatostatin- or VIP-immunoreactive cells were depolarized with spike firing. CCK-immunoreactive cells were affected heterogeneously by cholinergic agonists. Larger CCK cells were hyperpolarized, followed by a slow depolarization, whereas smaller CCK cells were only depolarized. These results suggest that the excitability of cortical GABAergic cell subtypes is differentially regulated by acetylcholine. Differences in cholinergic responses suggest a distinct functional role of each GABAergic cell subtype.},

abstract = {Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler distance-a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions-and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics.},

abstract = {Spinal interneurons are partially phase-locked to physiological tremor around 10 Hz. The phase of spinal interneuron activity is approximately opposite to descending drive to motoneurons, leading to partial phase cancellation and tremor reduction. Pre-synaptic inhibition of afferent feedback modulates during voluntary movements, but it is not known whether it tracks more rapid fluctuations in motor output such as during tremor. In this study, dorsal root potentials (DRPs) were recorded from the C8 and T1 roots in two macaque monkeys following intra-spinal micro-stimulation (random inter-stimulus interval 1.5-2.5 s, 30-100 $\mu$A), whilst the animals performed an index finger flexion task which elicited peripheral oscillations around 10 Hz. Forty one responses were identified with latency {\textless} 5 ms; these were narrow (mean width 0.59 ms), and likely resulted from antidromic activation of afferents following stimulation near terminals. Significant modulation during task performance occurred in 16/41 responses, reflecting terminal excitability changes generated by pre-synaptic inhibition (Wall's excitability test). Stimuli falling during large-amplitude 8-12 Hz oscillations in finger acceleration were extracted, and sub-averages of DRPs constructed for stimuli delivered at different oscillation phases. Although some apparent phase-dependent modulation was seen, this was not above the level expected by chance. We conclude that, although terminal excitability reflecting pre-synaptic inhibition of afferents modulates over the timescale of a voluntary movement, it does not follow more rapid changes in motor output. This suggests that pre-synaptic inhibition is not part of the spinal systems for tremor reduction described previously, and that it plays a role in overall-but not moment-by-moment-regulation of feedback gain.},

This book offers an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems theory for researchers and graduate students in neuroscience. It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum—or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology. This book offers neuroscience students and researchers a comprehensive account of concepts and methods increasingly used in computational neuroscience.An additional chapter on synchronization, with more advanced material, can be found at the author's website, www.izhikevich.com.},

This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems.

How the cholinergic input modulates the activity of different subtypes of cortical neurons remains unclear. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in layers 1 and 2/3 of mouse visual cortex, we show that electrical stimulation of the BF bi-directionally modulates the activity of excitatory neurons as well as several subtypes of inhibitory interneurons. While glutamatergic activity contributed to the activation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the contribution of acetylcholine (ACh) was more complex. Excitatory and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons were activated through muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) at low levels of cortical desynchronization and suppressed through nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) when cortical desynchronization was strong. In contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive (VIP+) and layer 1 interneurons were preferentially activated through nAChRs during strong cortical desynchronization. Thus, cholinergic input from the BF causes a significant shift in the relative activity levels of different subtypes of cortical neurons at increasing levels of cortical desynchronization.},

Many L5/6 neurons exhibited sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials with the same latencies as L4. Paired in vivo recordings from L5/6 neurons and thalamic neurons revealed substantial convergence of direct TC synapses onto diverse types of infragranular neurons, particularly in L5B. Pharmacological inactivation of L4 had no effect on sensory-evoked synaptic input to L5/6 neurons. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two separate, independent "strata" of cortex in parallel.},

abstract = {This review provides an overview of the interaction between the mammalian cholinergic system and circadian system, and its possible role in time memory. Several studies made clear that circadian (daily) fluctuations in acetylcholine (ACh) release, cholinergic enzyme activity and cholinergic receptor expression varies remarkably between species and even strains. Apparently, cholinergic features can be flexibly adjusted to the needs of a species or strain. Nevertheless, it can be generalized that circadian rhythmicity in the cholinergic system is characterized by high ACh release during the active phase of an individual. During the active phase, the activity of the ACh synthesizing enzyme Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT) is enhanced, and the activity of the ACh degrading enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is reduced. The number of free, unbound and thus available muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) is highest when ACh release is lowest. The cholinergic innervation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the hypothalamic circadian master clock, arises from the cholinergic forebrain and brain stem nuclei. The density of cholinergic fibers and terminals is modest as compared to other hypothalamic nuclei. This is the case for rat, hamster and mouse, three chronobiological model rodent species studied by us. A new finding is that the rat SCN contains some local cholinergic neurons. Hamster SCN contains less cholinergic neurons, whereas the mouse SCN is devoid of such cells. ACh has an excitatory effect on SCN cells (at least . in vivo), and functions in close interaction with other neurotransmitters. Originally it was thought that ACh transferred retinal light information to the SCN. This turned out to be wrong. Thereafter, the phase shifting effects of ACh prompted researches to view ACh as an agent for nocturnal clock resetting. It is still not clear, however, what the function consequence is of SCN cholinergic neurotransmission. Here, we postulate the hypothesis that cholinergic neurotransmission in the SCN provides the brain with a mechanism to support the formation of time memory via 'time stamping'. We define time memory as the memory of a specific time of the day, for which an animal made an association with a certain event and/or location (for example in case of time-place association). We use the term 'time stamping' to refer to the process underlying the encoding of a specific time of day (the time stamp). Only relatively brief but arousing events seem to be time stamped at SCN level. This time stamping requires the engagement of mAChRs. New data suggests that the SCN uses the neuropeptide vasopressin (AVP) as an output system to transfer the specific time of day information to other brain regions such as hippocampus and neocortex where time memory is supposed to be acquired, consolidated and stored.

abstract = {Cognitive functions rely on the coordinated activity of neurons in many brain regions, but the interactions between cortical areas are not yet well understood. Here we investigated whether low-frequency (alpha) and high-frequency (gamma) oscillations characterize different directions of information flow in monkey visual cortex. We recorded from all layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and found that gamma-waves are initiated in input layer 4 and propagate to the deep and superficial layers of cortex, whereas alpha-waves propagate in the opposite direction. Simultaneous recordings from V1 and downstream area V4 confirmed that gamma- and alpha-waves propagate in the feedforward and feedback direction, respectively. Microstimulation in V1 elicited gamma-oscillations in V4, whereas microstimulation in V4 elicited alpha-oscillations in V1, thus providing causal evidence for the opposite propagation of these rhythms. Furthermore, blocking NMDA receptors, thought to be involved in feedback processing, suppressed alpha while boosting gamma. These results provide new insights into the relation between brain rhythms and cognition},

abstract = {ACh release into the rodent prefrontal cortex is predictive of successful performance of cue detection tasks, yet the cellular mechanisms underlying cholinergic modulation of cortical function are not fully understood. Prolonged ("tonic") muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) activation increases the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons, whereas transient ("phasic") mAChR activation generates inhibitory and/or excitatory responses, depending on neuron subtype. These cholinergic effects result from activation of "M1-like" mAChRs (M1, M3, and M5 receptors), but the specific receptor subtypes involved are not known. We recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons from wild-type mice and mice lacking M1, M3, and/or M5 receptors to determine the relative contribution of M1-like mAChRs to cholinergic signaling in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Wild-type neurons in layer 5 were excited by tonic mAChR stimulation, and had biphasic inhibitory followed by excitatory, responses to phasic ACh application. Pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 were substantially less responsive to tonic and phasic cholinergic input. Cholinergic effects were largely absent in neurons from mice lacking M1 receptors, but most were robust in neurons lacking M3, M5, or both M3 and M5 receptors. The exception was tonic cholinergic suppression of the afterhyperpolarization in layer 5 neurons, which was absent in cells lacking either M1 or M3 receptors. Finally, we confirm a role for M1 receptors in behavior by demonstrating cue detection deficits in M1-lacking mice. Together, our results demonstrate that M1 receptors facilitate cue detection behaviors and are both necessary and sufficient for most direct effects of ACh on pyramidal neuron excitability.},

abstract = {We studied the cholinergic modulation of glutamatergic transmission between neighboring layer 5 regular-spiking pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortical slices from young rats (P10-P26). Brief bath application of 5-10 microM carbachol, a nonspecific cholinergic agonist, decreased the amplitude of evoked unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). This effect was blocked by 1 microM atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Nicotine (10 microM), in contrast to carbachol, reduced EPSPs in nominally magnesium-free solution but not in the presence of 1 mM Mg+2, indicating the involvement of NMDA receptors. Likewise, when the postsynaptic cell was depolarized under voltage clamp to allow NMDA receptor activation in the presence of 1 mM Mg+2, synaptic currents were reduced by nicotine. Nicotinic EPSP reduction was prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 (50 microM) and by the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (10 microM). Both carbachol and nicotine reduced short-term depression of EPSPs evoked by 10 Hz stimulation, indicating that EPSP reduction happens via reduction of presynaptic glutamate release. In the case of nicotine, several possible mechanisms for NMDAR-dependent EPSP reduction are discussed. As a result of NMDA receptor dependence, nicotinic EPSP reduction may serve to reduce the local spread of cortical excitation during heightened sensory activity.},

@article{Hutcheon1996,
abstract = {1. We obtained whole cell data from sensorimotor cortical neurons of in vitro slices (juvenile rats) and observed a low-frequency resonance (1-2 Hz) in their voltage responses. We constructed models of subthreshold membrane currents to determine whether a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (IH) is sufficient to account for this resonance. 2. Parameter values for a basic IH (BH) model were estimated from voltage-clamp experiments at room temperature. The BH model formed a component of a reduced membrane (RM) model. On numerical integration, the RM model exhibited voltage sags and rebounds to injected current pulses; maximal voltage responses to injected oscillatory currents occurred near 2 Hz. 3. We compared the experimentally measured frequency-response curves (FRCs) at room temperature with the theoretical FRCs derived from the RM model. The theoretical FRCs exhibited resonant humps with peaks between 1 and 2 Hz. At 36 degrees C, the theoretical FRCs peaked near 10 Hz. The characteristics of theoretical and observed FRCs were in close agreement, demonstrating that IH is sufficient to cause resonance. Thus we classified IH as a resonator current. 4. We developed a technique, the reactive current clamp (RCC), to inject a computer-calculated current corresponding to a membrane ionic current in response to the membrane potential of the neuron. This enabled us to study the interaction of an artificial ionic current with living neurons (electronic pharmacology or EP-method). Using the RCC, a simplified version of the BH model was used to cancel an endogenous IH (electronic antagonism) and to introduce an artificial IH (electronic expression) when an endogenous IH was absent. Antagonism of IH eliminated sags and rebounds, whereas expression of IH endowed neurons with resonance and the frequency-selective firing that accompanies resonance in neurons with an endogenous IH. Previous investigations have relied on the specificity of pharmacological agents to block ionic channels, e.g., Cs+ to block IH. However, Cs+ additionally affects other currents. This represents the first time an in vitro modeling technique (RCC) has been used to antagonize a specific endogenous current, IH. 5. A simplified RM model yielded values of the resonant frequency and Q (an index of the sharpness of resonance), which rose almost linearly between -55 and -80 mV. Resonant frequencies could be much higher than fH = (2 pi tau H) - 1 where tau H is the activation time constant for IH. 6. In the FRCs, resonance appeared as a hump at intermediate frequencies because of low- and high-frequency attenuations due to IH and membrane capacitance, respectively. Changing the parameters of IH altered the low-frequency attenuation and, hence, the resonance. Changes in the leak conductance affected both the low- and high-frequency attenuations. 7. We modeled an inwardly rectifying K+ current (IIR) and a persistent Na+ current (INaP) to study their effects on resonance. Neither current produced resonance in the absence of IH. We found that IIR attenuated, whereas INaP amplified resonance. Thus IIR and INaP are classified as attenuator and amplifier currents, respectively. 8. Resonators and attenuators differ in that they have longer and shorter time constants, respectively, compared with the membrane time constant. Therefore, an increase in the leak conductance decreases the membrane time constant, which can transform an attenuator into a resonator, altering the frequency response. This suggests a novel mechanism for modulating the frequency responses of neurons to inputs. 9. These investigations have provided a theoretical framework for detailed understanding of mechanisms that produce resonance in cortical neurons. Resonance is one aspect of the intrinsic rhythmicity of neurons. The rhythmicity due to IH resonance is latent until it is revealed by oscillatory inputs. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

A relatively novel neuronal pathway involving interplay between acetylcholine and the melanocortins, ??MSH and AGRP in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) of the hypothalamus projecting to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) may bridge this gap. In the fasted condition, increased expression of MCH (due to muscarinic-3 receptor stimulation and low melanocortin tone) and neuronal release of MCH (via Orexin signaling) underlies a drive towards positive energy balance, increased B cell capacity to secrete insulin, and this is associated with optimal fluid homeostasis. A hypohydrated state is hypothesized to yield downregulation of leptin signaling (potentially via inhibitory effects of osmotic stress on mTOR), but osmotic stress may prevent MCH expression via the OVLT-SFO complex. If this occurs in an obese state, impaired pancreatic B cell capacity and peripheral insulin insensitivity as a result of hypohydration may underlie cardio-metabolic diseases. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the cell-type specific connectivity and activity of local cortical networks have been characterized experimentally to some detail. In parallel, modeling has been established as a tool to relate network structure to activity dynamics. While available comprehensive connectivity maps ( Thomson, West, et al. 2002; Binzegger et al. 2004) have been used in various computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity such as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings. Here, we analyze the properties of these maps to compile an integrated connectivity map, which additionally incorporates insights on the specific selection of target types. Based on this integrated map, we build a full-scale spiking network model of the local cortical microcircuit. The simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and cell-type specific firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in awake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. The interplay of excitation and inhibition captures the flow of activity through cortical layers after transient thalamic stimulation. In conclusion, the integration of a large body of the available connectivity data enables us to expose the dynamical consequences of the cortical microcircuitry.},

abstract = {Cross-frequency interactions between oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) are thought to support communication between brain structures by temporally coordinating neural activity. It is unknown, however, whether such interactions differentiate between different levels of performance in decision-making tasks. Here, we investigated theta (4-12 Hz) to gamma (30-100 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling in LFP recordings from rat orbitofrontal cortex. Across subsequent periods of a task in which rats learned to discriminate two odors associated with positive and negative outcomes, theta-to-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was highest during the odor-sampling task period that preceded a Go/NoGo decision. This task-dependent modulation could not be explained by changes in oscillatory power and appeared to be time-locked to odor onset, not to the timing of the behavioral response. We found that PAC strength during odor sampling correlated with learning, as indexed by improved performance across trials. Moreover, this increase in PAC magnitude was apparent only on trials with correct Go and NoGo decisions, but not incorrect Go decisions. In addition, we found that PAC preferred coupling phase showed consistency over sessions only for correct, but not incorrect trials. In conclusion, orbitofrontal cortex theta-gamma PAC strength differentiates between different levels of performance in an olfactory decision-making task and may play a role in the generation and utilization of stimulus-based outcome predictions, necessary for adaptive decision-making.},

abstract = {1. Pyramidal neurones from layers II and III of the rat primary somatosensory cortex and cat primary visual cortex were studied in vitro. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and responses to exogenously applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its analogue baclofen were characterized. The results from rats and cats were very similar. 2. Single electrical stimuli to deep cortical layers evoked a sequence of PSPs in the resting neurone: (a) an initial, brief excitation (EPSP), (b) a short-latency, fast inhibition (the f-IPSP) and (c) a long-latency, more prolonged inhibition (the l-IPSP). The f-IPSP was accompanied by a large conductance increase (about 70-90 nS) and reversed polarity at -75 mV; the l-IPSP displayed a relatively small conductance increase (about 10-20 nS) and reversed at greater than -90 mV. 3. Focal application of GABA near the soma evoked a triphasic response when measured near the threshold voltage for action potentials: (a) the GABAhf (hyperpolarizing, fast) phase was very brief and was generated by a large conductance increase with a reversal potential of -78 mV, (b) the GABAd (depolarizing) phase also had a high conductance but reversed at -51 mV, (c) the GABAhl (hyperpolarizing, long-lasting) phase had a relatively low conductance and reversed at -70 mV. The GABAhf response was specifically localized to the soma, whereas the apical or basilar dendrites generated predominantly GABAd responses. 4. Baclofen, a selective GABAB receptor agonist, caused a small (about 2 mV), slow hyperpolarization of the resting potential, which reversed at -90 mV. Saturating baclofen doses increased membrane conductance by a maximum of about 12 nS. Baclofen depressed the amplitude and conductance of PSPs; when baclofen was focally applied near the soma. IPSPs were selectively depressed. 5. The GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline methiodide or picrotoxin (10 microM) greatly depressed f-IPSPs, but either enhanced or did not affect l-IPSPs. Concomitantly, GABAhf and GABAd responses were antagonized, leaving a more prominent GABAhl response that reversed polarity at a more negative level of -87 mV. Baclofen responses were unaffected by bicuculline and picrotoxin. Extracellular barium abolished the baclofen response, and shifted the reversal potentials of the GABAd and GABAhl responses in the positive direction; the GABAhf response was unaffected. 6. Both focal GABA and f-IPSPs strongly depressed the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurones. Each greatly increased spike threshold and abolished or vastly reduced the capacity of the cells to fire repetitively during intense stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In particular, we treat oscillations as the (observable) signature of context-sensitive changes in synaptic efficacy that underlie coordinated dynamics and message-passing in the brain. This rich source of information is now being exploited by various procedures-like dynamic causal modelling-to test hypotheses about neuronal circuits in health and disease. Furthermore, the roles played by neuromodulatory mechanisms can be addressed directly through their effects on oscillatory phenomena. These neuromodulatory or gain control processes are central to many theories of normal brain function (e.g. attention) and the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease). ?? 2014.},

abstract = {During development, sensory systems switch from an immature to an adult mode of function along with the emergence of the active cortical states. Here, we used patch-clamp recordings from neocortical slices in vitro to characterize the developmental changes in the basic electrophysiological properties of excitatory L4 neurons and their connectivity before and after the developmental switch, which occurs in the rat barrel cortex in vivo at postnatal day P8. Prior to the switch, L4 neurons had lower resting membrane potentials, higher input resistance, lower membrane capacity, as well as action potentials (APs) with smaller amplitudes, longer durations and higher AP thresholds compared to the neurons after the switch. A sustained firing pattern also emerged around the switch. Dual patch-clamp recordings from L4 neurons revealed that recurrent connections between L4 excitatory cells do not exist before and develop rapidly across the switch. In contrast, electrical coupling between these neurons waned around the switch. We suggest that maturation of electrophysiological features, particularly acquisition of a sustained firing pattern, and a transition from the immature electrical to mature chemical synaptic coupling between excitatory L4 neurons, contributes to the developmental switch in the cortical mode of function.},

Quantitative analysis and biophysically realistic neural modeling of the MEG mu rhythm: rhythmogenesis and modulation of sensory-evoked responses. J Neurophysiol 102: 3554 –3572, 2009. First published October 7, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00535.2009. Varia-tions in cortical oscillations in the alpha (7–14 Hz) and beta (15–29 Hz) range have been correlated with attention, working memory, and stimulus detection. The mu rhythm recorded with magnetoencepha-lography (MEG) is a prominent oscillation generated by Rolandic cortex containing alpha and beta bands. Despite its prominence, the neural mechanisms regulating mu are unknown. We characterized the ongoing MEG mu rhythm from a localized source in the finger representation of primary somatosensory (SI) cortex. Subjects showed variation in the relative expression of mu-alpha or mu-beta, which were nonoverlapping for roughly 50{\%} of their respective durations on single trials. To delineate the origins of this rhythm, a biophysically principled computational neural model of SI was developed, with distinct laminae, inhibitory and excitatory neurons, and feedforward (FF, representative of lemniscal thalamic drive) and feedback (FB, representative of higher-order cortical drive or input from nonlemnis-cal thalamic nuclei) inputs defined by the laminar location of their postsynaptic effects. The mu-alpha component was accurately mod-eled by rhythmic FF input at approximately 10-Hz. The mu-beta component was accurately modeled by the addition of approximately 10-Hz FB input that was nearly synchronous with the FF input. The relative dominance of these two frequencies depended on the delay between FF and FB drives, their relative input strengths, and stochas-tic changes in these variables. The model also reproduced key features of the impact of high prestimulus mu power on peaks in SI-evoked activity. For stimuli presented during high mu power, the model predicted enhancement in an initial evoked peak and decreased sub-sequent deflections. In agreement, the MEG-evoked responses showed an enhanced initial peak and a trend to smaller subsequent peaks. These data provide new information on the dynamics of the mu rhythm in humans and the model provides a novel mechanistic interpretation of this rhythm and its functional significance.},

abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Oscillations in network activity are ubiquitous in the brain and are involved in diverse cognitive functions. Oscillation characteristics, such as power, frequency and temporal structure, depend on both network connectivity and intrinsic cellular properties, such as ion channel composition. An important class of channels, with key roles in regulating cell excitability, are h-channels. The h-current (Ih) is a slow, hyperpolarization-activated, depolarizing current that contributes to neuronal resonance and membrane potential. The impact of Ih on network oscillations, however, remains poorly understood. To elucidate the network effects of Ih, we used a computational model of a generic oscillatory neuronal network consisting of inhibitory and excitatory cells that were externally driven by excitatory action potentials and sustained depolarizing currents. We found that Ih increased the oscillation frequency and, in combination with external action potentials, representing input from areas outside the network, strongly decreased the synchrony of firing. As a consequence, the oscillation power and the duration of episodes during which the network exhibited high-amplitude oscillations were greatly reduced in the presence of Ih. Our results suggest that modulation of Ih or impaired expression of h-channels, as observed in epilepsy, could, by affecting oscillation dynamics, markedly alter network-level activity and potentially influence oscillation-dependent cognitive processes such as learning, memory and attention.},

Although evidence suggests that populations of cortical neurons synchronize their activity to preferentially transmit information about attentional priorities, it is unclear how cortical synchrony across a network is accomplished. Based on its anatomical connectivity with the cortex, we hypothesized that the pulvinar, a thalamic nucleus, regulates cortical synchrony. We mapped pulvino-cortical networks within the visual system, using diffusion tensor imaging, and simultaneously recorded spikes and field potentials from these interconnected network sites in monkeys performing a visuospatial attention task.

The model provides geometric illustrations to many interesting phenomena occurring in biological neurons having subthreshold damped oscillations of membrane potential. For example, such neurons prefer a certain resonant frequency of the input that is nearly equal to their eigenfrequency, they can be excited or inhibited by a doublet (two pulses) depending on its interspike interval, and they can fire in response to an inhibitory input. All these properties could be observed in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models. We use the resonate-and-fire model to illustrate possible sensitivity of biological neurons to the fine temporal structure of the input spike train. Being an analogue of the integrate-and-fire model, the resonate-and-fire model is computationally efficient and suitable for simulations of large networks of spiking neurons. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Ethanol consumption produces a wide range of effects on the central nervous system, most of them related to changes in neural receptors. In vitro studies have demonstrated that ethanol increases neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nnAChR) affinity for ACh (Narahashi et al., 1991) and have also reported differences in sensitivity of nnAChRs for ethanol, depending on the subunit composition of the receptor (Cardoso et al., 1999). There is evidence that ethanol induces changes in density of nnAChRs in cellular cultures (Gorbounova et al., 1998). However, there are no clear results concerning the effects of chronic ethanol on nicotinic receptors and on behavior in rats nonselected by their preference to ethanol. A number of studies demonstrate that nnAChRs participate in a variety of functions, including memory and learning processes, neurodegeneration, and neuroprotection (Picciotto et al., 2000). In the present work, we found significant alterations in the Fixed-Interval Behavioral Test, as well as in density and affinity parameters of hippocampal main subtypes of nnAChRs: alpha7 homopentamers and alpha4beta2 heteropentamers of ethanol-drinking rats nonselected by their preference to ethanol.},

abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus is the best understood thalamic relay and serves as a model for all thalamic relays. Only 5-10{\%} of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem. These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.},

abstract = {A quintessential feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization, and characterizing the activity patterns in different layers is an important step in understanding cortical processing. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings in rat visual cortex, we show that the temporal patterns of ongoing synaptic inputs to pyramidal neurons exhibit clear laminar specificity. Although low-frequency (approximately 2 Hz) activity is widely observed in layer 2/3 (L2/3), a narrow-band fast oscillation (10-15 Hz) is prominent in layer 5 (L5). This fast oscillation is carried exclusively by excitatory inputs. Moreover, the frequency of ongoing activity is strongly correlated with the spatiotemporal window of visual integration: Neurons with fast-oscillating spontaneous inputs exhibit transient visual responses and small receptive fields (RFs), whereas those with slow inputs show prolonged responses and large RFs. These findings suggest that the neural representation of visual information within each layer is strongly influenced by the temporal dynamics of the local network manifest in spontaneous activity.},

abstract = {Historically, ACh has been implicated in learning and short-term memory functions. However, more recent studies have provided support for a role of cortical ACh in attentional effort, orienting and the detection of behavioral significant stimuli. The current review article summarizes studies in animals and humans which have investigated the role of ACh in attention and cognition. An attempt has been made to differentiate between brain regions involved in attentional processes versus those important for other cognitive functions. To this purpose, various experimental methods and interventions were used. Animal behavioral studies have injected the selective immunotoxin IgG-saporin to induce specific cholinergic lesions, employed electrochemical techniques such as microdialysis, or have administered cholinergic compounds into discrete parts of the brain. Human studies that give some indication on the link between central cholinergic signaling and cognition are obviously confined to less invasive, imaging methods such as fMRI. The brain areas that are deemed most important for intact attentional processing in both animals and humans appear to be the (pre)frontal, parietal and somatosensory (especially visual) regions, where ACh plays a vital role in the top-down control of attentional orienting and stimulus discrimination. In contrast, cholinergic signaling in the septohippocampal system is suggested to be involved in memory processes. Thus, it appears that the role of ACh in cognition is different per brain region and between nicotinic versus muscarinic receptor subtypes. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

To study the underlying mechanisms, we recorded neurons in cortical area V4 while macaque monkeys attended to behaviorally relevant stimuli and ignored distracters. Neurons activated by the attended stimulus showed increased gamma-frequency (35 to 90 hertz) synchronization but reduced low-frequency ({\textless}17 hertz) synchronization compared with neurons at nearby V4 sites activated by distracters. Because postsynaptic integration times are short, these localized changes in synchronization may serve to amplify behaviorally relevant signals in the cortex.},

abstract = {Cortical rhythms have been thought to play crucial roles in our cognitive abilities. Rhythmic activity in the beta frequency band, around 20 Hz, has been reported in recent studies that focused on neural correlates of attention, indicating that top-down beta rhythms, generated in higher cognitive areas and delivered to earlier sensory areas, can support attentional gain modulation. To elucidate functional roles of beta rhythms and underlying mechanisms, we built a computational model of sensory cortical areas. Our simulation results show that top-down beta rhythms can activate ascending synaptic projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. In the simulation, slow-inhibitory interneurons are shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate the activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. The predicted critical roles of these cells in attentional gain provide a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention.},

We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov–Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it can fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing. We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend ...},

abstract = {Acetlylcholine (ACh) in the central nervous system is critical for a multitude of functions. Here, we concentrate on declarative memory in humans, and its equivalent episodic-like memory in rodents and highlight current understanding of cholinergic system in these processes. Spatial memory formation represents a simple form of episodic-like memory in rodents that engages the basal forebrain cholinergic system and its target structures. In these, ACh exerts numerous functions. During spatial acquisition learning, ACh efflux into the extracellular space is immediate in hippocampus and cortex; during consolidation of spatial reference memory, ACh levels are low. These requirements explain why ACh receptor blockade during acquisition blocks memory formation, and it is also consonant with the notion that an unspecific enhancement of cholinergic activity during consolidation is detrimental to memory formation. Working and short-term memory for spatial locations engages the nucleus basalis - prefrontal cortex ACh system. ACh activity is trial related and maintained for some time post-training. Striatal cholinergic activity is increased during stimulus-response learning and behavioural flexibility (reversal learning, extinction) providing a possible switch between different behavioural strategies. At present, there is no clear difference between muscarinic and nicotinergic systems with respect to spatial learning. Antagonists of the respective receptors impair memory formation, agonists can reverse these deficits or may, under specific conditions act more like a general cognitive enhancers by way of improving attention. Data reviewed here do not provide conclusive evidence for muscarinic or nicotinic receptors presenting as novel therapeutic targets, and there is no clear indication for ACh derived novel biomarkers for translational medicine.Unresolved and contradictory results are highlighted and discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Pharmacological and genetic manipulations have indicated that the cholinergic and dopaminergic system in the striatum modulate each other's function. In addition to modulating the dopaminergic system, nicotinic cholinergic receptors facilitate GABA release, whereas muscarinic receptors attenuate GABA release. The striatal cholinergic system has also been implicated in various cognitive functions including procedural learning and intradimensional set shifting.

abstract = {Anatomic connections between brain areas affect information flow between neuronal circuits and the synchronization of neuronal activity. However, such structural connectivity does not coincide with effective connectivity (or, more precisely, causal connectivity), related to the elusive question "Which areas cause the present activity of which others?". Effective connectivity is directed and depends flexibly on contexts and tasks. Here we show that dynamic effective connectivity can emerge from transitions in the collective organization of coherent neural activity. Integrating simulation and semi-analytic approaches, we study mesoscale network motifs of interacting cortical areas, modeled as large random networks of spiking neurons or as simple rate units. Through a causal analysis of time-series of model neural activity, we show that different dynamical states generated by a same structural connectivity motif correspond to distinct effective connectivity motifs. Such effective motifs can display a dominant directionality, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking and effective entrainment between local brain rhythms, although all connections in the considered structural motifs are reciprocal. We show then that transitions between effective connectivity configurations (like, for instance, reversal in the direction of inter-areal interactions) can be triggered reliably by brief perturbation inputs, properly timed with respect to an ongoing local oscillation, without the need for plastic synaptic changes. Finally, we analyze how the information encoded in spiking patterns of a local neuronal population is propagated across a fixed structural connectivity motif, demonstrating that changes in the active effective connectivity regulate both the efficiency and the directionality of information transfer. Previous studies stressed the role played by coherent oscillations in establishing efficient communication between distant areas. Going beyond these early proposals, we advance here that dynamic interactions between brain rhythms provide as well the basis for the self-organized control of this "communication-through-coherence", making thus possible a fast "on-demand" reconfiguration of global information routing modalities.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique which extracts statistically independent components from a set of measured signals. The technique enjoys numerous applications in biomedical signal analysis in the literature, especially in the analysis of electromagnetic (EM) brain signals. Standard implementations of ICA are restrictive mainly due to the square mixing assumption-for signal recordings which have large numbers of channels, the large number of resulting extracted sources makes the subsequent analysis laborious and highly subjective. There are many instances in neurophysiological analysis where there is strong a priori information about the signals being sought; temporally constrained ICA (cICA) can extract signals that are statistically independent, yet which are constrained to be similar to some reference signal which can incorporate such a priori information. We demonstrate this method on a synthetic dataset and on a number of artifactual waveforms identified in multichannel recordings of EEG and MEG. cICA repeatedly converges to the desired component within a few iterations and subjective analysis shows the waveforms to be of the expected morphologies and with realistic spatial distributions. This paper shows that cICA can be applied with great success to EM brain signal analysis, with an initial application in automating artifact extraction in EEG and MEG.},

abstract = {The precision of the neural code is commonly investigated using two families of statistical measures: Shannon mutual information and derived quantities when investigating very small populations of neurons and Fisher information when studying large populations. These statistical tools are no longer the preserve of theorists and are being applied by experimental research groups in the analysis of empirical data. Although the relationship between information-theoretic and Fisher-based measures in the limit of infinite populations is relatively well understood, how these measures compare in finite-size populations has not yet been systematically explored. We aim to close this gap. We are particularly interested in understanding which stimuli are best encoded by a given neuron within a population and how this depends on the chosen measure. We use a novel Monte Carlo approach to compute a stimulus-specific decomposition of the mutual information (the SSI) for populations of up to 256 neurons and show that Fisher information can be used to accurately estimate both mutual information and SSI for populations of the order of 100 neurons, even in the presence of biologically realistic variability, noise correlations, and experimentally relevant integration times. According to both measures, the stimuli that are best encoded are those falling at the flanks of the neuron's tuning curve. In populations of fewer than around 50 neurons, however, Fisher information can be misleading.},

abstract = {Neuronal oscillations in various frequency bands have been reported in numerous studies in both humans and animals. While it is obvious that these oscillations play an important role in cognitive processing, it remains unclear how oscillations in various frequency bands interact. In this study we have investigated phase to power locking in MEG activity of healthy human subjects at rest with their eyes closed. To examine cross-frequency coupling, we have computed coherence between the time course of the power in a given frequency band and the signal itself within every channel. The time-course of the power was calculated using a sliding tapered time window followed by a Fourier transform. Our findings show that high-frequency gamma power (30-70 Hz) is phase-locked to alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in the ongoing MEG signals. The topography of the coupling was similar to the topography of the alpha power and was strongest over occipital areas. Interestingly, gamma activity per se was not evident in the power spectra and only became detectable when studied in relation to the alpha phase. Intracranial data from an epileptic subject confirmed these findings albeit there was slowing in both the alpha and gamma band. A tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system is inhibited during most of the alpha cycle whereas a burst of gamma activity at a specific alpha phase (e.g. at troughs) reflects a window of excitability.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is secreted from cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain to regions throughout the cerebral cortex, including the primary visual cortex (V1), and influences neuronal activities across all six layers via a form of diffuse extrasynaptic modulation termed volume transmission. To understand this effect in V1, we performed extracellular multi-point recordings of neuronal responses to drifting sinusoidal grating stimuli from the cortical layers of V1 in anesthetized rats and examined the modulatory effects of topically administered ACh. ACh facilitated or suppressed the visual responses of individual cells with a laminar bias: response suppression prevailed in layers 2/3, whereas response facilitation prevailed in layer 5. ACh effects on the stimulus contrast-response function showed that ACh changes the response gain upward or downward in facilitated or suppressed cells, respectively. Next, ACh effects on the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and the grating-phase information were tested. The grating-phase information was calculated as the F1/F0 ratio, which represents the amount of temporal response modulation at the fundamental frequency (F1) of a drifting grating relative to the mean evoked response (F0). In facilitated cells, ACh improved the S/N ratio, while in suppressed cells it enhanced the F1/F0 ratio without any concurrent reduction in the S/N ratio. These effects were predominantly observed in regular-spiking cells, but not in fast-spiking cells. Electrophysiological and histological findings suggest that ACh promotes the signaling of grating-phase information to higher-order areas by a suppressive effect on supragranular layers and enhances feedback signals with a high S/N ratio to subcortical areas by a facilitatory effect on infragranular layers. Thus, ACh distinctly and finely controls visual information processing in a manner that is specific for the modulation and cell type and is also laminar dependent.},

Slice physiology research has demonstrated that many neuromodulators differentially modulate afferent, incoming information compared to intrinsic and recurrent processing in cortical structures such as piriform cortex, neocortex, and the hippocampus. The enhancement of afferent (external) pathways versus the suppression at recurrent (internal) pathways could cause cortical dynamics to switch between a predominant influence of external stimulation to a predominant influence of internal recall.

These models have been used both with current- and conductance-based synapses. However, the differences in the dynamics expressed by these two approaches have been so far mainly studied at the single neuron level. To investigate how these synaptic models affect network activity, we compared the single neuron and neural population dynamics of conductance-based networks (COBNs) and current-based networks (CUBNs) of LIF neurons. These networks were endowed with sparse excitatory and inhibitory recurrent connections, and were tested in conditions including both low- and high-conductance states. We developed a novel procedure to obtain comparable networks by properly tuning the synaptic parameters not shared by the models. The so defined comparable networks displayed an excellent and robust match of first order statistics (average single neuron firing rates and average frequency spectrum of network activity). However, these comparable networks showed profound differences in the second order statistics of neural population interactions and in the modulation of these properties by external inputs. The correlation between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents and the cross-neuron correlation between synaptic inputs, membrane potentials and spike trains were stronger and more stimulus-modulated in the COBN. Because of these properties, the spike train correlation carried more information about the strength of the input in the COBN, although the firing rates were equally informative in both network models. Moreover, the network activity of COBN showed stronger synchronization in the gamma band, and spectral information about the input higher and spread over a broader range of frequencies. These results suggest that the second order statistics of network dynamics depend strongly on the choice of synaptic model.},

abstract = {Mammalian brains generate internal activity independent of environmental stimuli. Internally generated states may bring about distinct cortical processing modes. To investigate how brain state impacts cortical circuitry, we recorded intracellularly from the same neurons, under anesthesia and subsequent wakefulness, in rat barrel cortex. In every cell examined throughout layers 2-6, wakefulness produced a temporal pattern of synaptic inputs differing markedly from those under anesthesia. Recurring periods of synaptic quiescence, prominent under anesthesia, were abolished by wakefulness, which produced instead a persistently depolarized state. This switch in dynamics was unaffected by elimination of afferent synaptic input from thalamus, suggesting that arousal alters cortical dynamics by neuromodulators acting directly on cortex. Indeed, blockade of noradrenergic, but not cholinergic, pathways induced synaptic quiescence during wakefulness. We conclude that global brain states can switch local recurrent networks into different regimes via direct neuromodulation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Hasselmo2004,
abstract = {This chapter focuses on how the different physiological effects of acetylcholine could interact to alter specific functional properties of the cortex. Computational modeling demonstrates that the combined physiological effects of acetylcholine serve to enhance the influence of afferent input on neuronal spiking activity, while reducing the influence of internal and feedback processing. Computational models also demonstrate how these network properties can be interpreted functionally as both enhancing attention to sensory stimuli and enhancing the encoding of new memories. The levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus and neocortex change dramatically during different stages of waking and sleep. High levels of acetylcholine during active waking may set appropriate dynamics for attention to sensory input or encoding of new information. At the same time, the cholinergic suppression of excitatory feedback connections prevents interference from internal processing of previously stored information. Lower levels of acetylcholine during quiet waking and slow wave sleep may provide a release from this suppression of excitatory feedback, allowing stronger spread of activity within the hippocampus and from hippocampus to entorhinal cortex, thereby facilitating the process of consolidation of separate memory traces.},

abstract = {Objective. The objective of our current study was to look for the EEG correlates that can reveal the engaged state of the brain while undertaking cognitive tasks. Specifically, we aimed to identify EEG features that could detect audio distraction during simulated driving. Approach. Time varying autoregressive (TVAR) analysis using Kalman smoother was carried out on short time epochs of EEG data collected from participants as they undertook two simulated driving tasks. TVAR coefficients were then used to construct all pole model enabling the identification of EEG features that could differentiate normal driving from audio distracted driving. Main results. Pole analysis of the TVAR model led to the visualization of event related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) patterns in the form of pole displacements in pole plots of the temporal EEG channels in the z plane enabling the differentiation of the two driving conditions. ERS in the EEG data has been demonstrated during audio distraction as an associated phenomenon. Significance. Visualizing the ERD/ERS phenomenon in terms of pole displacement is a novel approach. Although ERS/ERD has previously been demonstrated as reliable when applied to motor related tasks, it is believed to be the first time that it has been applied to investigate human cognitive phenomena such as attention and distraction. Results confirmed that distracted/non-distracted driving states can be identified using this approach supporting its applicability to cognition research.},

It selectively increases firing rates and affects tuning properties, including changing receptive field locations and sizes. Although these effects are well studied, their cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the cellular mechanisms, we combined iontophoretic pharmacological analysis of cholinergic receptors with single cell recordings in V1 while rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed a task that demanded top-down spatial attention. Attending to the receptive field of the V1 neuron under study caused an increase in firing rates. Here we show that this attentional modulation was enhanced by low doses of acetylcholine. Furthermore, applying the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced attentional modulation, whereas the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine had no systematic effect. These results demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms play a central part in mediating the effects of attention in V1.},

Recent research has uncovered a close association between electrical oscillations and resonance in neurons. Resonance is an easily measurable property that describes the ability of neurons to respond selectively to inputs at preferred frequencies. A variety of ionic mechanisms support resonance and oscillation in neurons. Understanding the basic principles involved in the production of resonance allows for a simplified classification of these mechanisms. The characterization of resonance and frequency preference captures those essential properties of neurons that can serve as a substrate for coordinating network activity around a particular frequency in the brain.},

abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

In particular, the strength of phase-amplitude CFC differs across brain areas in a task-relevant manner, changes quickly in response to sensory, motor and cognitive events, and correlates with performance in learning tasks. Importantly, whereas high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC might thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

abstract = {The basal forebrain cholinergic complex comprising medial septum, horizontal and vertical diagonal band of Broca, and nucleus basalis of Meynert provides the mayor cholinergic projections to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The cholinergic neurons of this complex have been assumed to undergo moderate degenerative changes during aging, resulting in cholinergic hypofunction that has been related to the progressing memory deficits with aging.However, the previous view of significant cholinergic cell loss during aging has been challenged. Neuronal cell loss was found predominantly in pathological aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, while normal aging is accompanied by a gradual loss of cholinergic function caused by dendritic, synaptic, and axonal degeneration as well as a decrease in trophic support. As a consequence, decrements in gene expression, impairments in intracellular signaling, and cytoskeletal transport may mediate cholinergic cell atrophy finally leading to the known age-related functional decline in the brain including aging-associated cognitive impairments.However, in pathological situations associated with cognitive deficits, such as Parkinsons's disease, Down-syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, Jakob-Creutzfeld disease, Korsakoff's syndrome, traumatic brain injury, significant degenerations of basal forebrain cholinergic cells have been observed. In presenile (early onset), and in the advanced stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), a severe loss of cortical cholinergic innervation has extensively been documented. In contrast, in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a prodromal stage of AD), and early forms of AD, apparently no cholinergic neurodegeneration but a loss of cholinergic function occurs. In particular imbalances in the expression of NGF, its precursor proNGF, the high and low NGF receptors, trkA and p75NTR, respectively, changes in acetylcholine release, high-affinity choline uptake, as well as alterations in muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression may contribute to the cholinergic dysfunction. These observations support the suggestion of a key role of the cholinergic system in the functional processes that lead to AD. Malfunction of the cholinergic system may be tackled pharmacologically by intervening in cholinergic as well as neurotrophic signaling cascades that have been shown to ameliorate the cholinergic deficit at early stages of the disease, and slow-down the progression. However, in contrast to many other, dementing disorders, in AD the cholinergic dysfunctions are accompanied by the occurrence of two major histopathological hallmarks such as ??-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, provoking the question whether they play a particular role in inducing or mediating cholinergic dysfunction in AD. Indeed, there is abundant evidence that ??-amyloid may trigger cholinergic dysfunction through action on ??7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affecting NGF signaling, mediating tau phosphorylation, interacting with acetylcholinesterase, and specifically affecting the proteome in cholinergic neurons. Therefore, an early onset of an anti ??-amyloid strategy may additionally be potential in preventing aging-associated cholinergic deficits and cognitive impairments. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

A novel fitting method was used to determine peak parameters in the range 2-35 Hz from a large sample of eyes-closed spectra, and their interrelationships were investigated. Findings were compared with a mean-field model of thalamocortical activity, which predicts near-harmonic relationships between peaks. The subject set consisted of 1424 healthy subjects from the Brain Resource International Database. Peaks in the theta range occurred on average near half the alpha peak frequency, while peaks in the beta range tended to occur near twice and three times the alpha peak frequency on an individual-subject basis. Moreover, for the majority of subjects, alpha peak frequencies were significantly positively correlated with frequencies of peaks in the theta and low and high beta ranges. Such a harmonic progression agrees semiquantitatively with theoretical predictions from the mean-field model. These findings indicate a common or analogous source for different rhythms, and help to define appropriate individual frequency bands for peak identification.},

abstract = {Laminar population analysis (LPA) is a method for analysis of electrical data recorded by linear multielectrodes passing through all lamina of cortex. Like principal components analysis (PCA) and independent components analysis (ICA), LPA offers a way to decompose the data into contributions from separate cortical populations. However, instead of using purely mathematical assumptions in the decomposition, LPA is based on physiological constraints, i.e., that the observed LFP (low-frequency part of signal) is driven by action-potential firing as observed in the MUA (multi-unit activity; high-frequency part of the signal). In the presently developed generalized laminar population analysis (gLPA) the set of basis functions accounting for the LFP data is extended compared to the original LPA, thus allowing for a better fit of the model to experimental data. This enhances the risk for overfitting, however, and we therefore tested various versions of gLPA on virtual LFP data in which we knew the ground truth. These synthetic data were generated by biophysical forward-modeling of electrical signals from network activity in the comprehensive, and well-known, thalamocortical network model developed by Traub and coworkers. The results for the Traub model imply that while the laminar components extracted by the original LPA method overall are in fair agreement with the ground-truth laminar components, the results may be improved by use of gLPA method with two (gLPA-2) or even three (gLPA-3) postsynaptic LFP kernels per laminar population.},

abstract = {Gamma oscillations are thought to transiently link distributed cell assemblies that are processing related information, a function that is probably important for network processes such as perception, attentional selection and memory. This 'binding' mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision; however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from approximately 25 to almost 150 Hz. Here we show that gamma oscillations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple CA1 to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal's current position, and CA3, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information. Fast gamma oscillations in CA1 were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 were coherent with slow gamma in CA3. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and CA3 were phase-locked to fast and slow CA1 gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the CA1 theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.},

abstract = {In this review, we focus on immature neurons and their regulation by the cholinergic system, both during cortical development as well as during adult neurogenesis. We discuss various studies that indicate roles for acetylcholine in precursor development and neuronal differentiation. Cholinergic neurons projecting from the basal forebrain innervate the cerebral cortex during critical periods of neuronal development. Acetylcholine stimulation may help to promote a favourable environment for neuronal maturation. Afferents and their cortical target cells interact and are likely to influence each other during the establishment and refinement of connections. Intracortical cholinergic interneurons similarly have a local effect on cortical circuits. Reduced cholinergic innervation during development hence leads to reduced cortical thickness and dendritic abnormalities. Acetylcholine is also likely to play a critical role in neuronal plasticity, as shown in the visual and barrel cortices. Spontaneous nicotinic excitation is also important during a brief developmental window in the first postnatal weeks leading to waves of neural activity, likely to have an effect on neurite extension, target selection and synaptogenesis. In the hippocampus such activity plays a role in the maturation of GABAergic synapses during the developmental shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing transmission. The cholinergic system also seems likely to regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult, positively promoting proliferation, differentiation, integration and potentially survival of newborn neurons. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The basal forebrain provides the primary source of cholinergic input to the cortex, and it has a crucial function in promoting wakefulness and arousal. However, whether rapid changes in basal forebrain neuron spiking in awake animals can dynamically influence sensory perception is unclear. Here we show that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons rapidly regulate cortical activity and visual perception in awake, behaving mice. Optogenetic activation of the cholinergic neurons or their V1 axon terminals improved performance of a visual discrimination task on a trial-by-trial basis. In V1, basal forebrain activation enhanced visual responses and desynchronized neuronal spiking; these changes could partly account for the behavioral improvement. Conversely, optogenetic basal forebrain inactivation decreased behavioral performance, synchronized cortical activity and impaired visual responses, indicating the importance of cholinergic activity in normal visual processing. These results underscore the causal role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in fast, bidirectional modulation of cortical processing and sensory perception.},

abstract = {Nested oscillation occurs when the amplitude of a faster rhythm is coupled to the phase of a slower rhythm. It has been proposed to underlie the discrete nature of perception and the capacity of working memory and is a phenomenon observable in human brain imaging data. This paper compares three published methods for detecting nested oscillation and a fourth method proposed in this paper. These are: (i) the modulation index, (ii) the phase-locking value (PLV), (iii) the envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC) and (iv) a general linear model (GLM) measure derived from ESC. We applied the methods to electrocorticographic (ECoG) data recorded during a working-memory task and to data from a simulated hippocampal interneuron network. Further simulations were then made to address the dependence of each measure on signal to noise level, coupling phase, epoch length, sample rate, signal nonstationarity, and multi-phasic coupling. Our overall conclusion is that the GLM measure is the best all-round approach for detecting nested oscillation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Previously, a method called score matching was proposed for computationally efficient yet (locally) consistent estimation of such models. The basic form of score matching is valid, however, only for models which define a differentiable probability density function over Rn. Therefore, some extensions of the framework are proposed. First, a related method for binary variables is proposed. Second, it is shown how to estimate non-normalized models defined in the non-negative real domain, i.e. R+n. As a further result, it is shown that the score matching estimator can be obtained in closed form for some exponential families. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

How independent gamma oscillations are generated and maintained by pyramidal cells and interneurons within a cortical circuit remains unknown. We recorded the spike timing of identified parvalbumin-expressing basket cells in the CA1 hippocampus of anesthetized rats and simultaneously detected layer-specific gamma oscillations using current-source-density analysis. Spike timing of basket cells tuned the phase and amplitude of gamma oscillations generated around stratum pyramidale, where basket cells selectively innervate pyramidal cells with GABAergic synapses. Basket cells did not contribute to gamma oscillations generated at the apical tuft of pyramidal cells. This gamma oscillation was selectively modulated by a subset of local GABAergic interneurons and by medial entorhinal cortex layer 3 neurons. The generation of independent and layer-specific gamma oscillations, implemented onto hippocampal pyramidal cells along their somato-dendritic axis, can be explained by selective axonal targeting and precisely controlled temporal firing of GABAergic interneurons. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Part of hippocampal or cortical plasticity is characterized by synaptic modifications as a function of the joint activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Whether those changes strongly depends on the exact timing, or more on the average firing rates, is still a matter of debate and may vary from areas to areas. However, it has been robustly observed both in vitro and in vivo, that plasticity itself slowly adapts as a function of the dynamic context, and this phenomena is commonly referred to as metaplasticity. An alternative concept considers the regulation of groups of synapses directly to approach a given average firing rate. Then, the change in the strength of a particular synapse of the group (e.g., due to Hebbian learning) will affect others' strengths, which has been coined as heterosynaptic plasticity. Classically, Hebbian synaptic plasticity is paired in neuron network models with such mechanisms so as to stabilize the activity and/or the weight structure. Here, we present a review of various concepts from heterosynaptic plasticity to metaplasticity that have been applied to several spiking models of plasticity, either in hippocampus or in cortex, and how they compete with classical Hebbian learning. We list and discuss the different approaches that are nowadays used by state of the art models of plasticity for incorporating those concepts. Making the point that metaplasticity is an ubiquitous mechanism promoting the stability of neural function over multiple timescales and acting on top of classical Hebbian learning, we stress the need for incorporating it as a key element in the framework of plasticity models.},

abstract = {Eye movements, eye blinks, cardiac signals, muscle noise, and line noise present serious problems for electroencephalographic (EEG) interpretation and analysis when rejecting contaminated EEG segments results in an unacceptable data loss. Many methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG recordings, especially those arising from eye movements and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic (EOG) recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally, regressing out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant EEG signals from each record as well. Regression methods become even more problematic when a good regressing channel is not available for each artifact source, as in the case of muscle artifacts. Use of principal component analysis (PCA) has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel EEG. However, PCA cannot completely separate eye artifacts from brain signals, especially when they have comparable amplitudes. Here, we propose a new and generally applicable method for removing a wide variety of artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA). Our results on EEG data collected from normal and autistic subjects show that ICA can effectively detect, separate, and remove contamination from a wide variety of artifactual sources in EEG records with results comparing favorably with those obtained using regression and PCA methods. ICA can also be used to analyze blink-related brain activity.},

We have developed an understanding of the circuit mechanisms that lead to correlations among cell pairs, but little is known about what determines the population firing statistics among larger groups of cells. Here, we examine this question for a simple, but ubiquitous, circuit feature: common fluctuating input arriving to spiking neurons of integrate-and-fire type. We show that this leads to strong beyond-pairwise correlations-that is, correlations that cannot be captured by maximum entropy models that extrapolate from pairwise statistics-as for earlier work with discrete threshold crossing (dichotomous Gaussian) models. Moreover, we find that the same is true for another widely used, doubly stochastic model of neural spiking, the linear-nonlinear cascade. We demonstrate the strong connection between the collective dynamics produced by integrate-and-fire and dichotomous Gaussian models, and show that the latter is a surprisingly accurate model of the former. Our conclusion is that beyond-pairwise correlations can be both broadly expected and possible to describe by simplified (and tractable) statistical models.},

Although independent component analysis (ICA) separates data in linearly independent components (IC), the classification of these components as artifact or EEG signal still requires visual inspection by experts. In this paper, we achieve automated artifact elimination using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of feature vectors extracted from ICA components via image processing algorithms. We compare the performance of this automated classifier to visual classification by experts and identify range filtering as a feature extraction method with great potential for automated IC artifact recognition (accuracy rate 88{\%}). We obtain almost the same level of recognition performance for geometric features and local binary pattern (LBP) features. Compared to the existing automated solutions the proposed method has two main advantages: First, it does not depend on direct recording of artifact signals, which then, e.g. have to be subtracted from the contaminated EEG. Second, it is not limited to a specific number or type of artifact. In summary, the present method is an automatic, reliable, real-time capable and practical tool that reduces the time intensive manual selection of ICs for artifact removal. The results are very promising despite the relatively small channel resolution of 25 electrodes.},

Reliable spike detection and analysis in such recordings is challenging due to the large amount of raw data, and the dense sampling of spikes with closely spaced electrodes. Here, we present a highly efficient, online capable spike detection algorithm, and an offline method with improved detection rates, which enables estimation of spatial event locations at a resolution higher than that provided by the array by combining information from multiple electrodes. Data acquired with a 4,096 channel MEA from neuronal cultures and the neonatal retina, as well as synthetic data was used to test and validate these methods. We demonstrate that these algorithms outperform conventional methods due to a better noise estimate and an improved signal-to-noise ratio through combining information from multiple electrodes. Finally, we present a new approach for analyzing population activity based on the characterization of the spatio-temporal event profile, which does not require the isolation of single units. Overall, we show how the improved spatial resolution provided by high density, large scale microelectrode arrays can be reliably exploited to characterize activity from large neural populations and brain circuits.},

abstract = {Analysis of information transfer has found rapid adoption in neuroscience, where a highly dynamic transfer of information continuously runs on top of the brain's slowly-changing anatomical connectivity. Measuring such transfer is crucial to understanding how flexible information routing and processing give rise to higher cognitive function. Directed Information Measures in Neuroscience reviews recent developments of concepts and tools for measuring information transfer, their application to neurophysiological recordings and analysis of interactions. Written by the most active researchers in the field the book discusses the state of the art, future prospects and challenges on the way to an efficient assessment of neuronal information transfer. Highlights include the theoretical quantification and practical estimation of information transfer, description of transfer locally in space and time, multivariate directed measures, information decomposition among a set of stimulus/responses variables and the relation between interventional and observational causality. Applications to neural data sets and pointers to open source software highlight the usefulness of these measures in experimental neuroscience. With state-of-the-art mathematical developments, computational techniques and applications to real data sets, this book will be of benefit to all graduate students and researchers interested in detecting and understanding the information transfer between components of complex systems.},

abstract = {Sensory information is processed and transmitted through the synaptic structure of local cortical circuits, but it is unclear how modulation of this architecture influences the cortical representation of sensory stimuli. Acetylcholine (ACh) promotes attention and arousal and is thought to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of sensory input in primary sensory cortices. Using high-speed 2-photon calcium imaging in a thalamocortical somatosensory slice preparation, we recorded action potential activity of up to 900 neurons simultaneously and compared local cortical circuit activations with and without bath presence of ACh. We found that ACh reduced weak pairwise relationships and excluded neurons that were already unreliable during circuit activity. Using action potential activity from the imaged population, we generated functional wiring diagrams based on the statistical dependencies of activity between neurons. ACh pruned weak functional connections from spontaneous circuit activations and yielded a more modular and hierarchical circuit structure, which biased activity to flow in a more feedforward fashion. Neurons that were active in response to thalamic input had reduced pairwise dependencies overall, but strong correlations were conserved. This coincided with a prolonged period during which neurons showed temporally precise responses to thalamic input. Our results demonstrate that ACh reorganizes functional circuit structure in a manner that may enhance the integration and discriminability of thalamic afferent input within local neocortical circuitry.},

abstract = {The cholinergic system is a potent neuromodulatory system that plays critical roles in cortical plasticity, attention and learning. In this review, we propose that the cellular effects of acetylcholine (ACh) in the primary visual cortex during the processing of visual inputs might induce perceptual learning; i.e., long-term changes in visual perception. Specifically, the pairing of cholinergic activation with visual stimulation increases the signal-to-noise ratio, cue detection ability and long-term facilitation in the primary visual cortex. This cholinergic enhancement would increase the strength of thalamocortical afferents to facilitate the treatment of a novel stimulus while decreasing the cortico-cortical signaling to reduce recurrent or top-down modulation. This balance would be mediated by different cholinergic receptor subtypes that are located on both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons of the different cortical layers. The mechanisms of cholinergic enhancement are closely linked to attentional processes, long-term potentiation (LTP) and modulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Recently, it was found that boosting the cholinergic system during visual training robustly enhances sensory perception in a long-term manner. Our hypothesis is that repetitive pairing of cholinergic and sensory stimulation over a long period of time induces long-term changes in the processing of trained stimuli that might improve perceptual ability. Various non-invasive approaches to the activation of the cholinergic neurons have strong potential to improve visual perception.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between structure and dynamics of the mammalian cortex is a key challenge of neuroscience. So far, it has been tackled in two ways: by modeling neurons or small circuits in great detail, and through large-scale models representing each area with a small number of differential equations. To bridge the gap between these two approaches, we construct a spiking network model extending earlier work on the cortical microcircuit by Potjans {\&} Diesmann (2014) to all 32 areas of the macaque visual cortex in the parcellation of Felleman {\&} Van Essen (1991). The model takes into account spe- cific neuronal densities and laminar thicknesses of the individual areas. The connectivity of the model combines recently updated binary tracing data from the CoCoMac database (Stephan et al., 2001) with quantitative tracing data providing connection densities (Markov et al., 2014a) and laminar connection patterns (Stephan et al., 2001; Markov et al., 2014b). We estimate missing data using structural regular- ities such as the exponential decay of connection densities with distance between areas (Ercsey-Ravasz et al., 2013) and a fit of laminar patterns versus logarithmic ratios of neuron densities. The model integrates a large body of knowledge on the structure of macaque visual cortex into a consistent framework that allows for progressive refinement.},

Using Jeffreys's Bayes factor hypothesis tests, researchers can grade the decisiveness of the evidence that the data provide for a point null hypothesis H0 versus a composite alternative hypothesis H1. Consequently, Jeffreys's tests are of considerable theoretical and practical relevance for empirical researchers in general and for experimental psychologists in particular. To highlight this relevance and to facilitate the interpretation and use of Jeffreys's Bayes factor tests we focus on two common inferential scenarios: testing the nullity of a normal mean (i.e., the Bayesian equivalent of the t-test) and testing the nullity of a correlation. For both Bayes factor tests, we explain their development, we extend them to one-sided problems, and we apply them to concrete examples from experimental psychology.},

@article{Nakasaki1989,
abstract = {Serial sequential sections from a single tumor were examined by immunohistological staining with several monoclonal antibodies directed, respectively, to different tumor-associated carbohydrate epitopes. Staining patterns were compared with those of conventional staining with hematoxylin-eosin or periodate/Schiff's reagent. Each tumor showed different areas of staining with different antibodies, and the combined staining map shows a clear mosaicism of antigen expression within the same tumor. For example, some areas of a given tumor were stained by FH4 (defining dimeric Le(x)), while other complementary areas were strongly stained, in a mutually exclusive manner, by SH1 (defining Le(x)), AH6 (defining Le(y)), FH6 (defining sialosyl dimeric (Le(x)), or TKH2 (defining sialosyl-Tn). Some areas were stained by two or three of these antibodies. Comparisons of the mosaic-staining patterns with cytohistological properties of tumor cells within specific areas suggested that the pattern of antigen expression is correlated with degree of differentiation; e.g., poorly-differentiated cells with severe dysplasia did not express high levels of Le(x) or Le(y) but did express sialyl-Le(x) or dimeric Le(x); on the other hand, moderately or well-differentiated tumor cells in some areas expressed high levels of Le(x) or Le(y) but lower levels of sialyl-Le(x). Areas showing strong expression of sialyl-Tn in their secretions were consistently correlated with presence of well-differentiated tumor cells, whereas secretions from normal mucosae were consistently characterized by lack of sialyl-Tn expression. It is postulated that the original in situ tumors (which had homogeneous glycosylation patterns) evolved into several spatially discrete cell populations displaying different degrees of glycosylation, reflecting stages of tumor cell differentiation and progression.},

abstract = {Human memory can store large amount of information. Nevertheless, recalling is often a challenging task. In a classical free recall paradigm, where participants are asked to repeat a briefly presented list of words, people make mistakes for lists as short as 5 words. We present a model for memory retrieval based on a Hopfield neural network where transition between items are determined by similarities in their long-term memory representations. Meanfield analysis of the model reveals stable states of the network corresponding (1) to single memory representations and (2) intersection between memory representations. We show that oscillating feedback inhibition in the presence of noise induces transitions between these states triggering the retrieval of different memories. The network dynamics qualitatively predicts the distribution of time intervals required to recall new memory items observed in experiments. It shows that items having larger number of neurons in their representation are statistically easier to recall and reveals possible bottlenecks in our ability of retrieving memories. Overall, we propose a neural network model of information retrieval broadly compatible with experimental observations and is consistent with our recent graphical model (Romani et al., 2013).},

abstract = {A small-world network has been suggested to be an efficient solution for achieving both modular and global processing-a property highly desirable for brain computations. Here, we investigated functional networks of cortical neurons using correlation analysis to identify functional connectivity. To reconstruct the interaction network, we applied the Ising model based on the principle of maximum entropy. This allowed us to assess the interactions by measuring pairwise correlations and to assess the strength of coupling from the degree of synchrony. Visual responses were recorded in visual cortex of anesthetized cats, simultaneously from up to 24 neurons. First, pairwise correlations captured most of the patterns in the population's activity and, therefore, provided a reliable basis for the reconstruction of the interaction networks. Second, and most importantly, the resulting networks had small-world properties; the average path lengths were as short as in simulated random networks, but the clustering coefficients were larger. Neurons differed considerably with respect to the number and strength of interactions, suggesting the existence of "hubs" in the network. Notably, there was no evidence for scale-free properties. These results suggest that cortical networks are optimized for the coexistence of local and global computations: feature detection and feature integration or binding.},

Specifically, we conciliate quantitative studies of microcircuitry and the functional logic of neuronal computations. We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference-paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

However, the neural mechanisms of these oscillations are largely unknown. Many pyramidal neurons in layer 5 ofthe neocortex showed prolonged, 5- to 12-hertz rhythmic firing patterns at threshold. Rhythmic firing was due to intrinsic membrane properties, sodium con- ductances were essential for rhythmicity, and calcium-dependent conductances strong- ly modified rhythmicity. Isolated slices ofneocortex generated epochs of4- to 10-hertz synchronized activity when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated channels were facilitated. Layer 5 was both necessary and sufficient to produce these synchronized oscillations. Thus, synaptic networks of intrinsically rhythmic neurons in layer 5 may generate or promote certain synchronized oscillations of the neocortex.},

abstract = {Cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) project to the cerebral cortex and are thought to play an important role in learning and memory, and other cognitive functions. In the present study, we examined the effects of NBM stimulation on the response properties of individual cortical neurons in layer V of the rat somatosensory cortex. Seventy-three neurons were studied before and after a brief electrical stimulation of NBM. Transient changes in spontaneous activity were observed in 60{\%} of the cells, and in most cases this background activity decreased. Recordings lasting more than 1 h stimulation were obtained from 56 cells. Because some NBM stimulation-induced effects lasted several hours, neurons were evaluated in two groups, NBM1 and NBM2. NBM1 neurons were those exposed to either the first NBM stimulation of the day or an NBM restimulation following a more than 5 h stimulation-free period. Neurons exposed to NBM restimulation following a stimulation free interval of less than 5 h were classified as NBM2. Sixty-nine percent of the 32 NBM1 neurons displayed marked decreases in spontaneous activity and/or increases in the response evoked by deflecting a contralateral facial vibrissa. NBM1 stimulation caused some units to respond to previously minimally effective whisker stimuli. Stimulation effects often lasted several hours. By contrast, long-lasting changes were observed in only 25{\%} of the 24 NBM2 neurons, and the only consistent effect was on spontaneous, not stimulus-evoked, activity. Systemic injection of atropine blocked NBM stimulation-induced changes in spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activities. Control neurons, studied without NBM stimulation, failed to display consistent alterations in their response properties during the course of 1 h or more. Results demonstrate that NBM activation produces long-lasting, cholinergically mediated alterations in the response properties of somatosensory cortical neurons. Effects were complex, being influenced by factors such as the time interval between successive stimulations during an experiment. The complexity of these NBM mediated effects should be considered when designing therapies for neurodegenerative disorders characterized by loss of NBM neurons.},

abstract = {Synchronization is one of the central phenomena involved in information processing in living systems. It is known that the nervous system requires the coordinated activity of both local and distant neural populations. Such an interplay allows to merge different information modalities in a whole processing supporting high-level mental skills as understanding, memory, abstraction, etc. Though, the biological processes underlying synchronization in the brain are not fully understood there have been reported a variety of mechanisms supporting different types of synchronization both at theoretical and experimental level. One of the more intriguing of these phenomena is the anticipating synchronization, which has been recently reported in a pair of unidirectionally coupled artificial neurons under simple conditions (Pyragiene and Pyragas, 2013), where the slave neuron is able to anticipate in time the behavior of the master one. In this paper, we explore the effect of spike anticipation over the information processing performed by a neural network at functional and structural level. We show that the introduction of intermediary neurons in the network enhances spike anticipation and analyse how these variations in spike anticipation can significantly change the firing regime of the neural network according to its functional and structural properties. In addition we show that the interspike interval (ISI), one of the main features of the neural response associated with the information coding, can be closely related to spike anticipation by each spike, and how synaptic plasticity can be modulated through that relationship. This study has been performed through numerical simulation of a coupled system of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons.},

abstract = {Persistent spiking activity is thought to be a cellular process involved in working memory. We have been interested in whether persistent activity also exists in cortical areas which are not involved in this memory process. To study the possible presence and the mechanisms of persistent activity in layer 5 pyramidal cells of the mouse primary somatosensory, visual and motor cortices, we used patch-clamp and calcium imaging techniques. A combination of cholinergic receptor activation and suprathreshold depolarization or sufficient extracellular stimulation leads to either a subthreshold afterdepolarization or suprathreshold persistent activity in these cortices. There is a continuum of response amplitudes depending on depolarization size. To initiate persistent activity, spikes have to be induced at a frequency of at least 20 Hz, if tested for 1 s. Acetylcholine muscarinic, but not nicotinic, receptors are important for initiating persistent activity. Persistent activity is an intrinsic cellular, not a network, phenomenon as it persists under blockade of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors. A rise in intracellular calcium concentration through voltage-gated calcium channels is needed for persistent activity initiation, while intracellular calcium stores are not crucial. The increased intracellular calcium concentration leads to the activation of calcium-sensitive nonspecific cationic channels. This study for the first time describes the presence and the underlying mechanisms of persistent activity in pyramidal cells of three primary sensory and motor cortex areas. These results thereby suggest that persistent activity may be a general capability of deep layer cortical pyramidal cells.},

abstract = {Modern imaging techniques for probing brain function, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, intrinsic and extrinsic contrast optical imaging, and magnetoencephalography, generate large data sets with complex content. In this paper we develop appropriate techniques for analysis and visualization of such imaging data to separate the signal from the noise and characterize the signal. The techniques developed fall into the general category of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively use the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific protocols for the analysis of fMRI, optical imaging, and MEG data, and illustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these imaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct stages: "noise" characterization and suppression, and "signal" characterization and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to account for nonstationarity in the data. Of particular note are 1) the development of a decomposition technique (space-frequency singular value decomposition) that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image data, and 2) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for the removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from cardiac and respiratory sources.},

abstract = {The human nervous system processes a continuous stream of multi-modal input from a rapidly changing environment. A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how the neural microcircuits (columns, minicolumns, etc.) in the cerebral cortex whose anatomical and physiological structure is quite similar in many brain areas and species achieve this enormous computational task. We propose a computational model that could explain the potentially universal computational capabilities and does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead it is based on principles of high dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory, and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. This new approach towards understanding neural computation on the micro-level also suggests new ways of modeling cognitive processing in larger neural systems. In particular it questions traditional ways of thinking about neural coding.},

The mechanisms underlying this change in gain are not understood. We performed whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 and layer 4 visual cortical excitatory neurons and from parvalbumin-positive and somatostatin-positive inhibitory neurons in mice that were free to rest or run on a spherical treadmill. We found that the membrane potential of all cell types became more depolarized and (with the exception of somatostatin-positive interneurons) less variable during locomotion. Cholinergic input was essential for maintaining the unimodal membrane potential distribution during immobility, whereas noradrenergic input was necessary for the tonic depolarization associated with locomotion. Our results provide a mechanism for how neuromodulation controls the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of visual cortical neurons during changes in the state of vigilance.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter critical for normal cognition. Here we demonstrate heterogeneity of cholinergic signaling in neocortical neurons in the rat prefrontal, somatosensory, and visual cortex. Focal ACh application (100 muM) inhibited layer 5 pyramidal neurons in all cortical areas via activation of an apamin-sensitive SK-type calcium-activated potassium conductance. Cholinergic inhibition was most robust in prefrontal layer 5 neurons, where it relies on the same signal transduction mechanism (M1-like receptors, IP(3)-dependent calcium release, and SK-channels) as exists in somatosensory pyramidal neurons. Pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 were less responsive to ACh, but substantial apamin-sensitive inhibitory responses occurred in deep layer 3 neurons of the visual cortex. ACh was only inhibitory when presented near the somata of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, where repetitive ACh applications generated discrete inhibitory events at frequencies of up to approximately 0.5 Hz. Fast-spiking (FS) nonpyramidal neurons in all cortical areas were unresponsive to ACh. When applied to non-FS interneurons in layers 2/3 and 5, ACh generated mecamylamine-sensitive nicotinic responses (38{\%} of cells), apamin-insensitive hyperpolarizing responses, with or without initial nicotinic depolarization (7{\%} of neurons), or no response at all (55{\%} of cells). Responses in interneurons were similar across cortical layers and regions but were correlated with cellular physiology and the expression of biochemical markers associated with different classes of nonpyramidal neurons. Finally, ACh generated nicotinic responses in all layer 1 neurons tested. These data demonstrate that phasic cholinergic input can directly inhibit projection neurons throughout the cortex while sculpting intracortical processing, especially in superficial layers.},

@article{Behuret2015,
abstract = {A reason why the thalamus is more than a passive gateway for sensory signals is that two-third of the synapses of thalamocortical neurons are directly or indirectly related to the activity of corticothalamic axons. While the responses of thalamocortical neurons evoked by sensory stimuli are well characterized, with ON- and OFF-center receptive field structures, the prevalence of synaptic noise resulting from neocortical feedback in intracellularly recorded thalamocortical neurons in vivo has attracted little attention. However, in vitro and modeling experiments point to its critical role for the integration of sensory signals. Here we combine our recent findings in a unified framework suggesting the hypothesis that corticothalamic synaptic activity is adapted to modulate the transfer efficiency of thalamocortical neurons during selective attention at three different levels: First, on ionic channels by interacting with intrinsic membrane properties, second at the neuron level by impacting on the input-output gain, and third even more effectively at the cell assembly level by boosting the information transfer of sensory features encoded in thalamic subnetworks. This top-down population control is achieved by tuning the correlations in subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations and is adapted to modulate the transfer of sensory features encoded by assemblies of thalamocortical relay neurons. We thus propose that cortically-controlled (de-)correlation of subthreshold noise is an efficient and swift dynamic mechanism for selective attention in the thalamus.},

The intended audience is researchers interested in applying mathematics to important problems in neuroscience, and neuroscientists who would like to understand how to create models, as well as the mathematical and computational methods for analyzing them. The authors take a very broad approach and use many different methods to solve and understand complex models of neurons and circuits. They explain and combine numerical, analytical, dynamical systems and perturbation methods to produce a modern approach to the types of model equations that arise in neuroscience. There are extensive chapters on the role of noise, multiple time scales and spatial interactions in generating complex activity patterns found in experiments. The early chapters require little more than basic calculus and some elementary differential equations and can form the core of a computational neuroscience course. Later chapters can be used as a basis for a graduate class and as a source for current research in mathematical neuroscience. The book contains a large number of illustrations, chapter summaries and hundreds of exercises which are motivated by issues that arise in biology, and involve both computation and analysis.

In the present study, we show that acetylcholine (ACh) can facilitate or depress synaptic transmission in occipital slices of mouse visual cortex. The precise nature of the ACh effects depends on the ACh concentration, and is input specific, as shown by stimulating different synaptic pathways. Pharmacological blockade of muscarinic receptor (mAChR) subtypes and the use of M1-M5 mAChR-deficient mice showed that specific mAChR subtypes, together with the activity of the cholinesterases (ChEs), mediate facilitation or depression of synaptic transmission. The present data suggest that local ACh, acting through mAChRs, regulates the cortical dynamics making cortical circuits respond to specific stimuli.},

abstract = {In the mammalian neocortex, the EEG reflects the state of behavioral arousal. The EEG undergoes a transformation, known as activation, during the transition from sleep to waking. Abundant evidence indicates the involvement of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in EEG activation; however, the cellular basis of this involvement remains unclear. We have used electrophysiological techniques with in vivo and in vitro preparations to demonstrate actions of endogenous ACh on neurons in auditory neocortex. In vivo stimulation of the nucleus basalis (NB), a primary source of neocortical ACh, (1) elicited EEG activation via cortical muscarinic receptors, (2) depolarized cortical neurons, and (3) produced a change in subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations from large-amplitude, slow (1-5 Hz) oscillations to low-amplitude, fast (20-40 Hz) oscillations. The NB-mediated change in pattern of membrane potential fluctuations resulted in a shift of spike discharge pattern from phasic to tonic. Stimulation of afferents in the in vitro neocortex elicited cholinergic actions on putative layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Acting via muscarinic receptors, endogenous ACh (1) reduced slow, rhythmic burst discharge and facilitated higher-frequency, single-spike discharge in burst-generating neurons, and (2) facilitated the appearance and magnitude of intrinsic membrane potential oscillations. These in vivo and in vitro observations suggest that neocortical activation results from muscarinic modulation of intrinsic neural oscillations and firing modes. Rhythmic-bursting pyramidal neurons in layer 5 may act as cortical pacemakers; if so, then modifying their discharge characteristics could alter local cortical networks. Larger, intercortical networks could also be modified, due to the widespread projections of NB neurons. Thus, NB cholinergic neurons may play a critical role in producing different states of neocortical function.},

abstract = {Modeling large-scale spiking neural networks showing realistic biological behavior in their dynamics is a complex and tedious task. Since these networks consist of millions of interconnected neurons, their simulation produces an immense amount of data. In recent years it has become possible to simulate even larger networks. However, solutions to assist researchers in understanding the simulation's complex emergent behavior by means of visualization are still lacking. While developing tools to partially fill this gap, we encountered the challenge to integrate these tools easily into the neuroscientists' daily workflow. To understand what makes this so challenging, we looked into the workflows of our collaborators and analyzed how they use the visualizations to solve their daily problems. We identified two major issues: first, the analysis process can rapidly change focus which requires to switch the visualization tool that assists in the current problem domain. Second, because of the heterogeneous data that results from simulations, researchers want to relate data to investigate these effectively. Since a monolithic application model, processing and visualizing all data modalities and reflecting all combinations of possible workflows in a holistic way, is most likely impossible to develop and to maintain, a software architecture that offers specialized visualization tools that run simultaneously and can be linked together to reflect the current workflow, is a more feasible approach. To this end, we have developed a software architecture that allows neuroscientists to integrate visualization tools more closely into the modeling tasks. In addition, it forms the basis for semantic linking of different visualizations to reflect the current workflow. In this paper, we present this architecture and substantiate the usefulness of our approach by common use cases we encountered in our collaborative work.},

abstract = {Many types of neurons exhibit subthreshold resonance. However, little is known about whether this frequency preference influences spike emission. Here, the link between subthreshold resonance and firing rate is examined in the framework of conductance-based models. A classification of the subthreshold properties of a general class of neurons is first provided. In particular, a class of neurons is identified in which the input impedance exhibits a suppression at a nonzero low frequency as well as a peak at higher frequency. The analysis is then extended to the effect of subthreshold resonance on the dynamics of the firing rate. The considered input current comprises a background noise term, mimicking the massive synaptic bombardment in vivo. Of interest is the modulatory effect an additional weak oscillating current has on the instantaneous firing rate. When the noise is weak and firing regular, the frequency most preferentially modulated is the firing rate itself. Conversely, when the noise is strong and firing irregular, the modulation is strongest at the subthreshold resonance frequency. These results are demonstrated for two specific conductance-based models and for a generalization of the integrate-and-fire model that captures subthreshold resonance. They suggest that resonant neurons are able to communicate their frequency preference to postsynaptic targets when the level of noise is comparable to that prevailing in vivo.},

abstract = {The nucleus basalis of the basal forebrain is an essential component of the neuromodulatory system controlling the behavioral state of an animal and it is thought to be important in regulating arousal and attention. However, the effect of nucleus basalis activation on sensory processing remains poorly understood. Using polytrode recording in rat visual cortex, we found that nucleus basalis stimulation caused prominent decorrelation between neurons and marked improvement in the reliability of neuronal responses to natural scenes. The decorrelation depended on local activation of cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the increased reliability involved distributed neural circuits, as evidenced by nucleus basalis-induced changes in thalamic responses. Further analysis showed that the decorrelation and increased reliability improved cortical representation of natural stimuli in a complementary manner. Thus, the basal forebrain neuromodulatory circuit, which is known to be activated during aroused and attentive states, acts through both local and distributed mechanisms to improve sensory coding.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine is a crucial neuromodulator for attention, learning and memory. Release of acetylcholine in primary sensory cortex enhances processing of sensory stimuli, and many in vitro studies have pinpointed cellular mechanisms that could mediate this effect. In contrast, how cholinergic modulation shapes the function of intact circuits during behaviour is only beginning to emerge. Here we review recent data on the recruitment of identified interneuron types in neocortex by cholinergic signalling, obtained with a combination of genetic targeting of cell types, two-photon imaging and optogenetics. These results suggest that acetylcholine release during basal forebrain stimulation, and during physiological recruitment of the basal forebrain, can strongly and rapidly influence the firing of neocortical interneurons. In contrast to the traditional view of neuromodulation as a relatively slow process, cholinergic signalling can thus rapidly convey time-locked information to neocortex about the behavioural state of the animal and the occurrence of salient sensory stimuli. Importantly, these effects strongly depend on interneuron type, and different interneuron types in turn control distinct aspects of circuit function. One prominent effect of phasic acetylcholine release is disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, which can facilitate sensory processing and associative learning.},

In the current review, we focus on the developmental aspects associated with major components of the cholinergic system: Acetylcholine, choline acetyltransferase, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, high-affinity choline transporter, acetylcholinesterase, nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. We describe when and where each one of these components is first identified in the CNS and the changes in their levels that occur during the course of prenatal and postnatal development. We also describe how these components are relevant to many events that occur during the development of the CNS, including progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, neuronal maturation and plasticity, axonal pathfinding, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. It will be noticed that evidence regarding the developmental aspects of the cholinergic system comes mostly from studies that used agonists, such as nicotine, and antagonists, such as hemicholinium-3. Studies using immunohistochemistry and genetically altered mice also provided valuable information. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Consequently, there is ample evidence to suggest the involvement of both nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the modulation of synaptic plasticity, which is believed to be the molecular correlate of learning and memory. In the hippocampus in particular, multiple subtypes of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors are present at presynaptic and postsynaptic loci of both principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons, where they exert profound bi-directional influences on synaptic transmission. Further evidence points to a role for cholinergic activation in the induction and maintenance of synaptic plasticity, and key influences on hippocampal network oscillations.

abstract = {This paper reports on findings from a million-cell granule cell model of the rat dentate gyrus that was used to explore the contributions of local interneuronal and associational circuits to network-level activity. The model contains experimentally derived morphological parameters for granule cells, which each contain approximately 200 compartments, and biophysical parameters for granule cells, basket cells, and mossy cells that were based both on electrophysiological data and previously published models. Synaptic input to cells in the model consisted of glutamatergic AMPA-like EPSPs and GABAergic-like IPSPs from excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively. The main source of input to the model was from layer II entorhinal cortical neurons. Network connectivity was constrained by the topography of the system, and was derived from axonal transport studies, which provided details about the spatial spread of axonal terminal fields, as well as how subregions of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices project to subregions of the dentate gyrus. Results of this study show that strong feedback inhibition from the basket cell population can cause high-frequency rhythmicity in granule cells, while the strength of feedforward inhibition serves to scale the total amount of granule cell activity. Results furthermore show that the topography of local interneuronal circuits can have just as strong an impact on the development of spatio-temporal clusters in the granule cell population as the perforant path topography does, both sharpening existing clusters and introducing new ones with a greater spatial extent. Finally, results show that the interactions between the inhibitory and associational loops can cause high frequency oscillations that are modulated by a low-frequency oscillatory signal. These results serve to further illustrate the importance of topographical constraints on a global signal processing feature of a neural network, while also illustrating how rich spatio-temporal and oscillatory dynamics can evolve from a relatively small number of interacting local circuits.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine is a ubiquitous cortical neuromodulator implicated in cognition. In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.},

Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlomethods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here,we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data.},

abstract = {Oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity has been proposed as a mechanism to modulate effective connectivity between interacting neuronal populations. In the visual system, oscillations in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz) are thought to subserve corticocortical communication. To test whether a similar mechanism might influence subcortical-cortical communication, we recorded local field potential activity from retinotopically aligned regions in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) of alert macaque monkeys viewing stimuli known to produce strong cortical gamma-band oscillations. As predicted, we found robust gamma-band power in V1. In contrast, visual stimulation did not evoke gamma-band activity in the LGN. Interestingly, an analysis of oscillatory phase synchronization of LGN and V1 activity identified synchronization in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands. Further analysis of directed connectivity revealed that alpha-band interactions mediated corticogeniculate feedback processing, whereas beta-band interactions mediated geniculocortical feedforward processing. These results demonstrate that although the LGN and V1 display functional interactions in the lower frequency bands, gamma-band activity in the alert monkey is largely an emergent property of cortex.},

abstract = {1. The electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of slow afterpotentials in large layer V neurons from cat sensorimotor cortex were studied in an in vitro slice preparation using intracellular recording and single-microelectrode voltage clamp. These properties were used to assess the role of afterpotential mechanisms in prolonged excitability changes. 2. The mean duration of a slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) was 13.5 s following 100 spikes evoked at 100 Hz. Its time course was best described by two exponential components, which decayed with time constants of several hundred milliseconds (the early sAHP) and several seconds (the late sAHP). The amplitude of both the early and late components were sensitive to membrane potential and raised extracellular K+ concentration [( K+]o). 3. The early sAHP was reduced when divalent cations were substituted for Ca2+, whereas the late sAHP was unaffected. We conclude that a Ca2+-mediated K+ conductance is responsible for much of the early sAHP. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), 1-s voltage-clamp steps were used to evoke slow AHPs or outward ionic currents. These AHPs and currents were abolished in Ca2+-free perfusate, but they had a maximum duration of only a few seconds. Thus the slowest outward currents we could observe during voltage clamp in TTX were responsible only for the early sAHP. 4. The possible role of an electrogenic Na+-K+ pump in the late sAHP was examined by applying ouabain to the slice. Ouabain did not reduce selectively the late sAHP, and its effect was best explained by a decrease in intracellular K+ concentration and an increase in [K+]o. 5. Muscarinic and beta-adrenergic agonists reduced or abolished the entire (early and late) sAHP. Neither type of agonist affected the Ca2+-dependent, apamin-sensitive medium-duration afterhyperpolarization (35). We conclude that both the Ca2+-mediated K+ conductance underlying the early sAHP and the Ca2+-independent mechanisms underlying the late sAHP are sensitive to at least two classes of transmitter agonists. 6. We focused on the muscarinic effects. When concentrations greater than 5 microM were employed, the entire (early and late) sAHP was replaced by a slow afterdepolarization (sADP). Muscarine reduced the sAHP directly by reducing the underlying outward ionic currents and indirectly by causing the sADP. The sADP was Ca2+-mediated, since it was abolished by Ca2+-free perfusate but not by TTX. 7. The ionic currents underlying the sAHP and the sADP influenced excitability for seconds following evoked repetitive firing.},

We derive the formulation of dependence and causality in the spectral domain from the more general formulation in the information-theory framework. We argue that the transfer entropy, the most general measure derived from the concept of Granger causality, lacks a spectral representation in terms of only the processes associated with the recorded signals. For all the spectral measures we show how they are related to mutual information rates when explicitly considering the parametric autoregressive representation of the processes. In this way we express the conditional Geweke spectral measure in terms of a multiple coherence involving innovation variables inherent to the autoregressive representation. We also link partial directed coherence with Sims' criterion of causality. Given our results, we discuss the causal interpretation of the spectral measures related to Granger causality and stress the necessity to explicitly consider their specific formulation based on modeling the signals as linear Gaussian stationary autoregressive processes.},

We tested the specificity of regulation in two excitatory pathways of the neocortex: thalamocortical (TC) synapses, which mediate specific inputs, and intracortical (IC) synapses, which mediate the recombination of cortical information. Frequency-sensitive depression was much stronger in TC synapses than in IC synapses. The two synapse types were differentially sensitive to presynaptic neuromodulators: only IC synapses were suppressed by activation of GABA(B) receptors, only TC synapses were enhanced by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors suppressed both synapse types. Modulators also differentially altered the frequency sensitivity of the synapses. Our results suggest a mechanism by which the relative strength and dynamics of input and associational pathways of neocortex are regulated during changes in behavioral state.},

abstract = {I propose that synchronization affects communication between neuronal groups. Gamma-band (30-90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8-20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7-8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.},

abstract = {This article provides an overview of present knowledge regarding the relationship between the cholinergic system and sigma-1 receptors, and discusses potential applications of sigma-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of memory deficits and cognitive disorders. Sigma-1 receptors, initially considered as a subtype of the opioid family, are unique ligand-regulated molecular chaperones in the endoplasmatic reticulum playing a modulatory role in intracellular calcium signaling and in the activity of several neurotransmitter systems, particularly the cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways. Several central nervous system (CNS) drugs show high to moderate affinities for sigma-1 receptors, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil), antipsychotics (haloperidol, rimcazole), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluvoxamine, sertraline) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (clorgyline). These compounds can influence cognitive functions both via their primary targets and by activating sigma-1 receptors in the CNS. Sigma-1 agonists show powerful anti-amnesic and neuroprotective effects in a large variety of animal models of cognitive dysfunction involving, among others pharmacologic target blockade (with muscarinic or NMDA receptor antagonists or p-chloroamphetamine); selective lesioning of cholinergic neurons; CNS administration of ??-amyloid peptides; aging-induced memory loss, both in normal and senescent-accelerated rodents; neurodegeneration induced by toxic compounds (CO, trimethyltin, cocaine), and prenatal restraint stress. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Objective: In this study we investigated the properties of infraslow oscillations (ISOs) ≤0.05 Hz and delta frequency band in the patients during the epileptic discharges and in healthy persons who performed a variety of mental and physical tasks. Methods: The EEG signals were recorded on the subjects who were divided into three groups. In the first group were patients with global epileptic seizures, while in the second group were patients with focal epileptic seizures. In the third group were healthy volunteers who performed different mental and physical tasks. Results: By analyzing EEG data of epileptic patients, we showed that frequency peak exists at 1.5 Hz which is typical for general and focal epileptic seizures. In the type of general epileptic discharges the role of the slow rhythms at 0.05 Hz, was particularly pronounced and their origin was in fluctuations of cortical neural network. The properties of parameter spectral coherency of ISOs in healthy persons point to their important role in brain functioning. Conclusions: Our results suggested that the role of ISOs could be extended, because they were detected in healthy human subjects during carrying out different tasks. Investigating the properties of parameter spectral coherency, we showed that in this case correlation between different regions of the brain was significantly modulated with ISOs.{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

For a multivariate dataset, one might be interested in different subsets of the recorded neurons or brain regions. According to the current estimation framework, for each subset, one conducts a separate autoregressive model fitting process, introducing the potential for unwanted variability and uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a multivariate framework for estimating Granger causality. It is based on spectral density matrix factorization and offers the advantage that the estimation of such a matrix needs to be done only once for the entire multivariate dataset. For any subset of recorded data, Granger causality can be calculated through factorizing the appropriate submatrix of the overall spectral density matrix.},

abstract = {A major challenge for computational neuroscience is to understand the computational function of lamina-specific synaptic connection patterns in stereotypical cortical microcircuits. Previous work on this problem had focused on hypothesized specific computational roles of individual layers and connections between layers and had tested these hypotheses through simulations of abstract neural network models. We approach this problem by studying instead the dynamical system defined by more realistic cortical microcircuit models as a whole and by investigating the influence that its laminar structure has on the transmission and fusion of information within this dynamical system. The circuit models that we examine consist of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with dynamic synapses, based on detailed data from Thomson and others (2002), Markram and others (1998), and Gupta and others (2000). We investigate to what extent this cortical microcircuit template supports the accumulation and fusion of information contained in generic spike inputs into layer 4 and layers 2/3 and how well it makes this information accessible to projection neurons in layers 2/3 and layer 5. We exhibit specific computational advantages of such data-based lamina-specific cortical microcircuit model by comparing its performance with various types of control models that have the same components and the same global statistics of neurons and synaptic connections but are missing the lamina-specific structure of real cortical microcircuits. We conclude that computer simulations of detailed lamina-specific cortical microcircuit models provide new insight into computational consequences of anatomical and physiological data.},

As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications.},

We inspect the properties of DCM in relation to the most common neuroimaging modalities (fMRI and EEG/MEG) and the specificity of inference on neural systems that can be made from these data. We then discuss both the plausibility of the underlying biophysical models and the robustness of the statistical inversion techniques.

abstract = {Traditional descriptions of the basal forebrain cholinergic projection system to the cortex have focused on neuromodulatory influences, that is, mechanisms that modulate cortical information processing but are not necessary for mediating discrete behavioral responses and cognitive operations. This review summarises and conceptualises the evidence in support of more deterministic contributions of cholinergic projections to cortical information processing. Through presynaptic receptors expressed on cholinergic terminals, thalamocortical and corticocortical projections can evoke brief cholinergic release events. These acetylcholine (ACh) release events occur on a fast, sub-second to seconds-long time scale ('transients'). In rats performing a task requiring the detection of cues as well as the report of non-cue events cholinergic transients mediate the detection of cues specifically in trials that involve a shift from a state of monitoring for cues to cue-directed responding. Accordingly, ill-timed cholinergic transients, generated using optogenetic methods, force false detections in trials without cues. We propose that the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that cholinergic transients reduce detection uncertainty in such trials. Furthermore, the evidence on the functions of the neuromodulatory component of cholinergic neurotransmission suggests that higher levels of neuromodulation favor staying-on-task over alternative action. In other terms, higher cholinergic neuromodulation reduces opportunity costs. Evidence indicating a similar integration of other ascending projection systems, including noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, into cortical circuitry remains sparse, largely because of the limited information about local presynaptic regulation and the limitations of current techniques in measuring fast and transient neurotransmitter release events in these systems.},

We propose a framework in which inhibitory alpha oscillations limit and prioritize neuronal processing. At oscillatory peaks, inhibition prevents neuronal firing. As the inhibition ramps down within a cycle, a set of neuronal representations will activate sequentially according to their respective excitability. Both top-down and bottom-up drives determine excitability; in particular, spatial attention is a major top-down influence. On a shorter time scale, fast recurrent inhibition segments representations in slots 10-30. ms apart, generating gamma-band activity at the population level. The proposed mechanism serves to convert spatially distributed representations in early visual regions to a temporal phase code: that is, 'to-do lists' that can be processed sequentially by downstream regions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

On the cholinoceptive site, the distribution and localisation of receptors that transduce the acetylcholine message, i.e. the muscarinic and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is summarized. In addition to these data obtained on post mortem brain an overview of markers which allow for the in vivo monitoring of the cholinergic system in the brain is given. The detailed knowledge on the distribution and localisation of cholinergic markers in human brain will provide further information on the cholinergic circuits of neurotransmission - a prerequisite for the interpretation of in vivo imaging data and the development of selective diagnostic and therapeutic compounds. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

For any prior distribution $\pi$ ($\theta$,$\omega$), the appropriate normative solution is obtained by rejecting the null model M0 whenever the corresponding posterior expectation {\$}\backslashmathop{\{}\backslashiint{\}}\backslashdelta (\backslashtheta {\_}{\{}0{\}},\backslashtheta,\backslashomega)\backslashpi (\backslashtheta,\backslashomega |x)d\backslashtheta \backslash d\backslashomega {\$} is sufficiently large. Specification of a subjective prior is always difficult, and often polemical, in scientific communication. Information theory may be used to specify a prior, the reference prior, which only depends on the assumed model M, and mathematically describes a situation where no prior information is available about the quantity of interest. The reference posterior expectation, d($\theta$ 0,x)=∫ $\delta$ $\pi$ ($\delta$ |x)d$\delta$ , of the amount of information $\delta$ ($\theta$ 0,$\theta$,$\omega$) which could be lost if the null model were used, provides an attractive non-negative test function, the intrinsic statistic, which is invariant under reparametrization. The intrinsic statistic d($\theta$ 0,x) is measured in units of information, and it is easily calibrated (for any sample size and any dimensionality) in terms of some average log-likelihood ratios. The corresponding Bayes decision rule, the Bayesian reference criterion (BRC), indicates that the null model M0 should only be rejected if the posterior expected loss of information from using the simplified model M0 is too large or, equivalently, if the associated expected average log-likelihood ratio is large enough. The BRC criterion provides a general reference Bayesian solution to hypothesis testing which does not assume a probability mass concentrated on M0 and, hence, it is immune to Lindley's paradox. The theory is illustrated within the context of multivariate normal data, where it is shown to avoid Rao's paradox on the inconsistency between univariate and multivariate frequentist hypothesis testing. /// Pour un mod{\`{e}}le probabiliste {\$}M\backslashequiv \backslash{\{}p(x|\backslashtheta,\backslashomega),\backslashtheta \backslashin \backslashTheta,\backslashomega \backslashin \backslashOmega \backslash{\}}{\$} cens{\'{e}} d{\'{e}}crire le comportement probabiliste de donn{\'{e}}es x∈ X, nous soutenons que tester si les donn{\'{e}}es sont compatibles avec une hypoth{\`{e}}se {\$}H{\_}{\{}0{\}}\backslashequiv \backslash{\{}\backslashtheta =\backslashtheta {\_}{\{}0{\}}\backslash{\}}{\$} doit {\^{e}}tre consid{\'{e}}r{\'{e}} comme un probl{\`{e}}me d{\'{e}}cisionnel concernant l'usage du mod{\`{e}}le {\$}M{\_}{\{}0{\}}\backslashequiv \backslash{\{}p(x|\backslashtheta {\_}{\{}0{\}},\backslashomega),\backslashomega \backslashin \backslashOmega \backslash{\}}{\$} , avec une fonction de co{\^{u}}t qui mesure la quantit{\'{e}} d'information qui peut {\^{e}}tre perdue si le mod{\`{e}}le simplifi{\'{e}} M0 est utilis{\'{e}} comme approximation du v{\'{e}}ritable mod{\`{e}}le M.

abstract = {A recent continuum model of the large scale electrical activity of the thalamocortical system is generalized to include cholinergic modulation. The model is examined analytically and numerically to determine the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on its steady states, linear stability, spectrum, and temporal responses. Changing the ACh concentration moves the system between zones of one, three, and five steady states, showing that neuromodulation of synaptic strength is a possible mechanism by which multiple steady states emerge in the brain. The lowest firing rate steady state is always stable, and subsequent fixed points alternate between stable and unstable. Increasing ACh concentration changes the form of the spectrum. Increasing the tonic level of ACh concentration increases the magnitudes of the N100 and P200 in the evoked response potential (ERP), without changing the timing of these peaks. Driving the system with a pulse of cholinergic activity results in a transient increase in the firing rate of cortical neurons that lasts over 10 s. Step-like increases in cortical ACh concentration cause increases in the firing rate of cortical neurons, with rapid responses due to fast acting nicotinic receptors and slower responses due to muscarinic receptor suppression of intracortical connections. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

By taking advantage of readily available technology, the authors eliminate most of the specialized techniques for deriving formulas for solutions found in traditional texts and replace them with topics that focus on the formulation of differential equations and the interpretations of their solutions. Students will generally attack a given equation from three different points of view to obtain an understanding of the solutions: qualitative, numeric, and analytic. Since many of the most important differential equations are nonlinear, students learn that numerical and qualitative techniques are more effective than analytic techniques in this setting. Overall, students discover how to identify and work effectively with the mathematics in everyday life, and they learn how to express the fundamental principles that govern many phenomena in the language of differential equations.},

@article{McCormick1985,
abstract = {Applications of acetylcholine (AcCho) to pyramidal cells of guinea pig cingulate cortical slices maintained in vitro result in a short latency inhibition, followed by a prolonged increase in excitability. Cholinergic inhibition is mediated through the rapid excitation of interneurons that utilize the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This rapid excitation of interneurons is associated with a membrane depolarization and a decrease in neuronal input resistance. In contrast, AcCho-induced excitation of pyramidal cells is due to a direct action that produces a voltage-dependent increase in input resistance. In the experiments reported here, we investigated the possibility that these two responses are mediated by different subclasses of cholinergic receptors. The inhibitory and slow excitatory responses of pyramidal neurons were blocked by muscarinic but not by nicotinic antagonists. Pirenzepine was more effective in blocking the AcCho-induced slow depolarization than in blocking the hyperpolarization of pyramidal neurons. The two responses also varied in their sensitivity to various cholinergic agonists, making it possible to selectively activate either. These data suggest that AcCho may produce two physiologically and pharmacologically distinct muscarinic responses on neocortical neurons: slowly developing voltage-dependent depolarizations associated with an increase in input resistance in pyramidal cells and short-latency depolarizations associated with a decrease in input resistance in presumed GABAergic interneurons.},

@article{Mccormick1986,
abstract = {SUMMARY 1. The mechanisms of action of acetylcholine (ACh) in the guinea-pig neocortex were investigated using intracellular recordings from layer V pyramidal cells of the anterior cingulate cortical slice. 2. At resting membrane potential (Vm =-80 to -70 mV), ACh application resulted in a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (p.s.p.s) associated with a decrease in apparent input resistance (Ri). 3. ACh, applied to pyramidal neurones depolarized to just below firing threshold (Vm = -65 to -55 mV), produced a short-latency hyperpolarization concomitant with p.s.p.s and a decrease in Ri, followed by a long-lasting (10 to {\textgreater} 60 s) depolarization and action potential generation. Both of these responses were also found in presumed pyramidal neurones of other cortical regions (sensorimotor and visual) and were blocked by muscarinic, but not nicotinic, antagonists. 4. The ACh-induced hyperpolarization possessed an average reversal potential of -75-8 mV, similar to that for the hyperpolarizing response to y-aminobutyric acid (GABA; -72-4 mV) and for the i.p.s.p. generated by orthodromic stimulation (-69-6 mV). This cholinergic inhibitory response could be elicited by ACh applications at significantly greater distance from the cell than the slow depolarizing response. 5. Blockade of GABAergic synaptic transmission with solution containing Mn2+ and low Ca2+, or by local application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), bicuculline or picrotoxin, abolished the ACh-induced inhibitory response but not the slow excitatory response. In TTX (or Mn2+, low Ca2+) the slow excitatory response possessed a minimum onset latency of 250 ms and was associated with a voltage-dependent increase in Ri. 6. Application of ACh caused short-latency excitation associated with a decrease in Ri in eight neurones. The time course of this excitation was similar to that of the inhibition seen in pyramidal neurones. Seven of these neurones had action potentials with unusually brief durations, indicating that they were probably non-pyramidal cells. 7. ACh blocked the slow after-hyperpolarization (a.h.p.) following a train of action potentials, occasionally reduced orthodromically evoked p.s.p.s, and had no effect on the width or maximum rate of rise or fall of the action potential. 8. It is concluded that cholinergic inhibition of pyramidal neurones is mediated through a rapid muscarinic excitation of non-pyramidal cells, resulting in the release D. A. McCORMICK AND D. A. PRINCE of GABA. In pyramidal cells ACh causes a relatively slow blockade of both a voltage-dependent hyperpolarizing conductance (M-current) which is most active at depolarized membrane potentials, and the Ca2+-activated K+ conductance underlying the a.h.p. These post-synaptic actions of ACh result in a potentiated response to depolarizing inputs with little or no change in Vm or responses to hyperpolarizing inputs. The ability of ACh to cause the release of GABA may allow the cholinergic system to regulate cortical inhibition also.},

abstract = {Increasing interest in the study of coordinated activity of brain cell ensembles reflects the current conceptualization of brain information processing and cognition. It is thought that cognitive processes involve not only serial stages of sensory signal processing, but also massive parallel information processing circuitries, and therefore it is the coordinated activity of neuronal networks of brains that give rise to cognition and consciousness in general. While the concepts and techniques to measure synchronization are relatively well characterized and developed in the mathematics and physics community, the measurement of coordinated activity derived from brain signals is not a trivial task, and is currently a subject of debate. Coordinated Activity in the Brain: Measurements and Relevance to Brain Function and Behavior addresses conceptual and methodological limitations, as well as advantages, in the assessment of cellular coordinated activity from neurophysiological recordings. The book offers a broad overview of the field for investigators working in a variety of disciplines (neuroscience, biophysics, mathematics, physics, neurology, neurosurgery, psychology, biomedical engineering, computer science/computational biology), and introduces future trends for understanding brain activity and its relation to cognition and pathologies. This work will be valuable to professional investigators and clinicians, graduate and post-graduate students in related fields of neuroscience and biophysics, and to anyone interested in signal analysis techniques for studying brain function},

abstract = {The specific functions of subtypes of cortical inhibitory neurons are not well understood. This is due in part to a dearth of information about the behaviors of interneurons under conditions when the surrounding circuit is in an active state. We investigated the firing behavior of a subset of inhibitory interneurons, identified using mice that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a subset of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory cells (“GFP-expressing inhibitory neuron” [GIN] cells). The somata of the GIN cells were in layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex and had dense, layer 1–projecting axons that are characteristic of Martinotti neurons. Interestingly, GIN cells fired similarly during a variety of diverse activating conditions: when bathed in fluids with low-divalent cation concentrations, when stimulated with brief trains of local synaptic inputs, when exposed to group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, or when exposed to muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonists. During these manipulations, GIN cells fired rhythmically and persistently in the theta-frequency range (3–10 Hz). Synchronous firing was often observed and its strength was directly proportional to the magnitude of electrical coupling between GIN cells. These effects were cell type specific: the four manipulations that persistently activated GIN cells rarely caused spiking of regular- spiking (RS) pyramidal cells or fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. Our results suggest that supragranular GIN interneurons form an electrically coupled network that exerts a coherent 3- to 10-Hz inhibitory influence on its targets. Because GIN cells are more readily activated than RS and FS cells, it is possible that they act as “first responders” when cortical excitatory activity increases.},

The membrane can then be described in terms of resistances, capacitances and inductances, as for instance in the small-signal analysis of the squid giant axon. Depending on the channel kinetics and the associated ionic battery the linearization yields two basic types of membrane: a membrane modeled by a collection of resistances and capacitances and membranes containing in addition to these components inductances. Under certain specified conditions the latter type of membrane gives rise to a membrane impedance that displays a prominent maximum at some nonzero resonant frequency fmax. We call this type of membrane quasi-active, setting it apart from the usual passive membrane. We study the linearized behaviour of active channels giving rise to quasi-active membranes in extended neuronal structures and consider several instances where such membranes may subserve neuronal function: 1. The resonant frequency of a quasi-active membrane increases with increasing density of active channels. This might be one of the biophysical mechanisms generating the large range over which hair cells in the vertebrate cochlea display frequency tuning. 2. The voltage recorded from a cable with a quasi-active membrane can be proportional to the temporal derivative of the injected current. 3. We modeled a highly branched dendritic tree ($\delta$-ganglion cell of the cat retina) using a quasi-active membrane. The voltage attenuation from a given synaptic site to the soma decreases with increasing frequency up to the resonant frequency, in sharp contrast to the behaviour of passive membranes. This might be the underlying biophysical mechanism of receptive fields whose dimensions are large for rapid signals but contract to a smaller area for slow signals as suggested by Detwiler et al. (1978).},

abstract = {The communication-through-coherence (CTC) hypothesis proposes that anatomical connections are dynamically rendered effective or ineffective through the presence or absence of rhythmic synchronization, in particular in the gamma and beta bands. The original CTC statement proposed that uni-directional communication is due to rhythmic entrainment with an inter-areal delay and a resulting non-zero phase relation, whereas bi-directional communication is due to zero-phase synchronization. Recent studies found that inter-areal gamma-band synchronization entails a non-zero phase lag. We therefore modify the CTC hypothesis and propose that bi-directional cortical communication is realized separately for the two directions by uni-directional CTC mechanisms entailing delays in both directions. We review evidence suggesting that inter-areal influences in the feedforward and feedback directions are segregated both anatomically and spectrally.},

abstract = {This paper reports a dynamic causal modeling study of electrocorticographic (ECoG) data that addresses functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections in the visual cortical hierarchy. Specifically, we ask whether forward connections employ gamma-band frequencies, while backward connections preferentially use lower (beta-band) frequencies. We addressed this question by modeling empirical cross spectra using a neural mass model equipped with superficial and deep pyramidal cell populations-that model the source of forward and backward connections, respectively. This enabled us to reconstruct the transfer functions and associated spectra of specific subpopulations within cortical sources. We first established that Bayesian model comparison was able to discriminate between forward and backward connections, defined in terms of their cells of origin. We then confirmed that model selection was able to identify extrastriate (V4) sources as being hierarchically higher than early visual (V1) sources. Finally, an examination of the auto spectra and transfer functions associated with superficial and deep pyramidal cells confirmed that forward connections employed predominantly higher (gamma) frequencies, while backward connections were mediated by lower (alpha/beta) frequencies. We discuss these findings in relation to current views about alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations and predictive coding in the brain.},

abstract = {The cholinergic systems play a pivotal role in learning and memory, and have been the centre of attention when it comes to diseases containing cognitive deficits. It is therefore not surprising, that the cholinergic transmitter system has experienced detailed examination of its role in numerous behavioural situations not least with the perspective that cognition may be rescued with appropriate cholinergic 'boosters'.Here we reviewed the literature on cholinergic lesions, pharmacological intervention of muscarinic or nicotinic system, or genetic deletion of selective receptor subtypes with respect to sensory discrimination and conditioning procedures. We consider visual, auditory, olfactory and somatosensory processing first before discussing more complex tasks such as startle responses, latent inhibition, negative patterning, eye blink and fear conditioning, and passive avoidance paradigms.An overarching reoccurring theme is that lesions of the cholinergic projection neurones of the basal forebrain impact negatively on acquisition learning in these paradigms and blockade of muscarinic (and to a lesser extent nicotinic) receptors in the target structures produce similar behavioural deficits. While these pertain mainly to impairments in acquisition learning, some rare cases extend to memory consolidation. Such single case observations warranted replication and more in-depth studies. Intriguingly, receptor blockade or receptor gene knockout repeatedly produced contradictory results (for example in fear conditioning) and combined studies, in which genetically altered mice are pharmacological manipulated, are so far missing. However, they are desperately needed to clarify underlying reasons for these contradictions.Consistently, stimulation of either muscarinic (mainly M1) or nicotinic (predominantly ??7) receptors was beneficial for learning and memory formation across all paradigms supporting the notion that research into the development and mechanisms of novel and better cholinomimetics may prove useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders with cognitive endophenotypes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cortical information processing originates from the exchange of action potentials between many cell types. To capture the essence of these interactions, it is of critical importance to build mathematical models that reflect the characteristic features of spike generation in individual neurons. We propose a framework to automatically extract such features from current-clamp experiments, in particular the passive properties of a neuron (i.e., membrane time constant, reversal potential, and capacitance), the spike-triggered adaptation currents, as well as the dynamics of the action potential threshold. The stochastic model that results from our maximum likelihood approach accurately predicts the spike times, the subthreshold voltage, the firing patterns, and the type of frequency-current curve. Extracting the model parameters for three cortical cell types revealed that cell types show highly significant differences in the time course of the spike-triggered currents and moving threshold, that is, in their adaptation and refractory properties but not in their passive properties. In particular, GABAergic fast-spiking neurons mediate weak adaptation through spike-triggered currents only, whereas regular spiking excitatory neurons mediate adaptation with both moving threshold and spike-triggered currents. GABAergic nonfast-spiking neurons combine the two distinct adaptation mechanisms with reduced strength. Differences between cell types are large enough to enable automatic classification of neurons into three different classes. Parameter extraction is performed for individual neurons so that we find not only the mean parameter values for each neuron type but also the spread of parameters within a group of neurons, which will be useful for future large-scale computer simulations.},

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

abstract = {Oscillations are omnipresent in neural population signals, like multi-unit recordings, EEG/MEG, and the local field potential. They have been linked to the population firing rate of neurons, with individual neurons firing in a close-to-irregular fashion at low rates. Using mean-field theory we predict the spectra generated in a layered microcircuit model of V1, composed of leaky-integrate and fire neurons and based on connectivity compiled from anatomical and electrophysiological studies. The model exhibits low-and high-$\gamma$ oscillations visible in all populations. Since locally generated frequencies are imposed onto other populations, the origin of the oscillations cannot be deduced from the spectra. We develop a universally applicable systematic approach that identifies the anatomical circuits underlying the generation of oscillations in a given network. Based on a mean-field reduction, we derive a sensitivity measure resulting in a frequency-dependent connectivity map that reveals connections crucial for the peak amplitude and frequency of the observed oscillations and identifies the minimal circuit generating a given frequency. The low-$\gamma$ peak turns out to be generated in a sub-circuit located in layer 2/3 and 4, while the high-$\gamma$ peak emerges from the inter-neurons in layer 4. Connections within and onto layer 5 are found to regulate slow rate fluctuations. We further demonstrate how small perturbations of the crucial connections have significant impact on the population spectra, while the impairment of other connections leaves the dynamics on the population level unaltered. The study uncovers the contact point for mechanisms regulating the spectra of the cortical microcircuit.},

Putting the cholinergic hypothesis in an historical perspective, allows to appreciate the enormous amount of experimental and clinical research that it has stimulated over years and the impressive extent of knowledge generated by this research. While some of the assumptions at the basis of its original formulation are disputable in the light of recent developments, the cholinergic hypothesis has, however, constituted an invaluable stimulus to better understand not only the anatomy and the biochemistry of the cholinergic systems of brain connections but also its developmental biology, its complex relationships with trophic factors, its role in cognitive functions. Thus, rather than being consigned to history, the cholinergic hypothesis will likely contribute to further understanding dementia and neurodegenerative diseases and will hopefully be integrated in novel therapies and treatments. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Different levels of cholinergic neuromodulatory tone have been hypothesized to set the state of cortical circuits either to one dominated by local cortical recurrent activity (low ACh) or to one dependent on thalamic input (high ACh). High ACh levels depress intracortical but facilitate thalamocortical synapses, whereas low levels potentiate intracortical synapses. Furthermore, recent work has implicated the thalamus in controlling cortical network state during waking and attention, when ACh levels are highest. To test this hypothesis, we used rat thalamocortical slices maintained in medium to generate spontaneous up- and down-states and applied different ACh concentrations to slices in which thalamocortical connections were either maintained or severed. The effects on spontaneous and evoked up-states were measured using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, intracellular recordings, local field potentials, and single/multiunit activity. We found that high ACh can increase the frequency of spontaneous up-states, but reduces their duration in slices with intact thalamocortical connections. Strikingly, when thalamic connections are severed, high ACh instead greatly reduces or abolishes spontaneous up-states. Furthermore, high ACh reduces the spatial propagation, velocity, and depolarization amplitude of evoked up-states. In contrast, low ACh dramatically increases up-state frequency regardless of the presence or absence of intact thalamocortical connections and does not reduce the duration, spatial propagation, or velocity of evoked up-states. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that strong cholinergic modulation increases the influence, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, of afferent input over local cortical activity and that lower cholinergic tone enhances recurrent cortical activity regardless of thalamic input.},

abstract = {1. The pedunculopontine tegmental (PPT) cholinergic nucleus and the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic nucleus were electrically stimulated to investigate their effects on the recently described slow oscillation (approximately 0.3 Hz) of neocortical neurons. Intracellular recordings of slowly oscillating, regular-spiking and intrinsically bursting neurons from cortical association areas 5 and 7 (n = 140) were performed in anesthetized cats. 2. Pulse trains to the PPT nucleus produced the blockage of rhythmic (approximately 0.3 Hz) depolarizing-hyperpolarizing sequences in 79{\%} of tested cortical neurons and transformed this slow cellular rhythm into tonic firing. The latency of the cortical cellular response to PPT stimulation was 1.2 +/- 0.5 (SE) s and its duration was 15.9 +/- 1.9 s. The PPT-elicited suppression of the slow cellular oscillation was accompanied by an activation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) having a similar time course. Fast Fourier transform analyses of EEG activities before and after PPT stimulation showed that the PPT-evoked changes consisted of decreased power of slow rhythms (0-8 Hz) and increased power of fast rhythms (24-33 Hz); these changes were statistically significant. 3. The blockage of the slow cellular oscillation was mainly achieved through the diminution or suppression of the long-lasting hyperpolarizations separating the rhythmic depolarizing envelopes. This effect was observed even when PPT pulse trains disrupted the oscillation without inducing overt depolarization and increased firing rate. The durations of the prolonged hyperpolarizations were measured during a 40-s window (20 s before and 20 s after the PPT pulse train) and were found to decrease from 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 s. The values of the product resulting from the duration (in seconds), the amplitude (in millivolts), and number of such hyperpolarizing events within 20-s periods were 51.5 +/- 5 and 5.1 +/- 1.9 before and after PPT stimulation, respectively. 4. The PPT effect was suppressed by systemic administration of a muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, but not by mecamylamine, a nicotinic antagonist. 5. The PPT effect on cellular and EEG cortical slow oscillation survived, although its duration was reduced, in animals with kainate-induced lesions of thalamic nuclei projecting to areas 5 and 7 (n = 3) as well as in animals with similar excitotoxic lesions leading to extensive neuronal loss in nucleus basalis (n = 2). These data indicate that the PPT effect is transmitted to neocortex through either thalamic or basal forebrain relays.},

abstract = {To find objects of interest in a cluttered and continually changing visual environment, humans must often ignore salient stimuli that are not currently relevant to the task at hand. Recent neuroimaging results indicate that the ability to prevent salience-driven distraction depends on the current level of attentional control activity in frontal cortex, but the specific mechanism by which this control activity prevents salience-driven distraction is still poorly understood. Here, we asked whether salience-driven distraction is prevented by suppressing salient distractors or by preferentially up-weighting the relevant visual dimension. We found that salient distractors were suppressed even when they resided in the same feature dimension as the target (that is, when dimensional weighting was not a viable selection strategy). Our neurophysiological measure of suppression--the PD component of the event-related potential--was associated with variations in the amount of time it took to perform the search task: distractors triggered the PD on fast-response trials, but on slow-response trials they triggered activity associated with working memory representation instead. These results demonstrate that during search salience-driven distraction is mitigated by a suppressive mechanism that reduces the salience of potentially distracting visual objects.},

abstract = {This technical paper offers a critical re-evaluation of (spectral) Granger causality measures in the analysis of biological timeseries. Using realistic (neural mass) models of coupled neuronal dynamics, we evaluate the robustness of parametric and nonparametric Granger causality. Starting from a broad class of generative (state-space) models of neuronal dynamics, we show how their Volterra kernels prescribe the second-order statistics of their response to random fluctuations; characterised in terms of cross-spectral density, cross-covariance, autoregressive coefficients and directed transfer functions. These quantities in turn specify Granger causality - providing a direct (analytic) link between the parameters of a generative model and the expected Granger causality. We use this link to show that Granger causality measures based upon autoregressive models can become unreliable when the underlying dynamics is dominated by slow (unstable) modes - as quantified by the principal Lyapunov exponent. However, nonparametric measures based on causal spectral factors are robust to dynamical instability. We then demonstrate how both parametric and nonparametric spectral causality measures can become unreliable in the presence of measurement noise. Finally, we show that this problem can be finessed by deriving spectral causality measures from Volterra kernels, estimated using dynamic causal modelling.},

abstract = {Information theory is a practical and theoretical framework developed for the study of communication over noisy channels. Its probabilistic basis and capacity to relate statistical structure to function make it ideally suited for studying information flow in the nervous system. As a framework it has a number of useful properties: it provides a general measure sensitive to any relationship, not only linear effects; its quantities have meaningful units which in many cases allow direct comparison between different experiments; and it can be used to study how much information can be gained by observing neural responses in single experimental trials, rather than in averages over multiple trials. A variety of information theoretic quantities are in common use in neuroscience - including the Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and mutual information. In this entry, we introduce and define these quantities. Further details on how these quantities can be estimated in practice are provided in the entry "Estimation of Information-Theoretic Quantities" and examples of application of these techniques in neuroscience can be found in the entry "Applications of Information-Theoretic Quantities in Neuroscience".},

We propose that coherence between two neuronal groups is a mechanism of efficient interaction, because it renders mutual input optimally timed and thereby maximally effective.

This coherence may contribute to an effective corticospinal interaction and shortened reaction times.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To use the neural signals preceding movement and motor imagery to predict which of the four movements/motor imageries is about to occur, and to access this utility for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

METHODS: Eight na{\"{i}}ve subjects performed or kinesthetically imagined four movements while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 29 channels over sensorimotor areas. The task was instructed with a specific stimulus (S1) and performed at a second stimulus (S2). A classifier was trained and tested offline at differentiating the EEG signals from movement/imagery preparation (the 1.5-s preceding movement/imagery execution).

RESULTS: Accuracy of movement/imagery preparation classification varied between subjects. The system preferentially selected event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) signals for classification, and high accuracies were associated with classifications that relied heavily on the ERD/ERS to discriminate movement/imagery planning.

CONCLUSIONS: The ERD/ERS preceding movement and motor imagery can be used to predict which of the four movements/imageries is about to occur. Prediction accuracy depends on this signal's accessibility.

SIGNIFICANCE: The ERD/ERS is the most specific pre-movement/imagery signal to the movement/imagery about to be performed.},

In this short review, we focus on the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system and try to demonstrate that understanding ACh-memory relationships requires taking into account two characteristics of memory function. First, this function is polymorphic and relies on multiple neural systems. It appears that hippocampal ACh may not only modulate specific computational function of the hippocampus but also contributes to the functional coordination of multiple memory systems in a task-dependent manner. Second, memorization implies different phases which are differentially regulated by ACh. Namely, several lines of evidence suggest a " biphasic" involvement with hippocampal ACh facilitating memory encoding but hampering memory consolidation and retrieval, and low hippocampal ACh promoting consolidation of declarative memory. By spotting major determinants of memory modulation by hippocampal ACh, we hope that the present non exhaustive review will help to improve our understanding of the complexity of ACh-memory relationships. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we show that a simplified, sparse inhibitory network of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons can reproduce some key features of striatal population activity, as observed in brain slices. In particular we develop a new metric to determine the conditions under which sparse inhibitory networks form anti-correlated cell assemblies with time-varying activity of individual cells. We find that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific sequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates similar inputs. Our results support the proposal that GABAergic connections between striatal projection neurons allow stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell assemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal GABAergic signaling may produce aberrant network-level information processing in disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.},

abstract = {Networks of model neurons were constructed and their activity was predicted using an iterated map based solely on the phase-resetting curves (PRCs). The predictions were quite accurate provided that the resetting to simultaneous inputs was calculated using the sum of the simultaneously active conductances, obviating the need for weak coupling assumptions. Fully synchronous activity was observed only when the slope of the PRC at a phase of zero, corresponding to spike initiation, was positive. A novel stability criterion was developed and tested for all-to-all networks of identical, identically connected neurons. When the PRC generated using N-1 simultaneously active inputs becomes too steep, the fully synchronous mode loses stability in a network of N model neurons. Therefore, the stability of synchrony can be lost by increasing the slope of this PRC either by increasing the network size or the strength of the individual synapses. Existence and stability criteria were also developed and tested for the splay mode in which neurons fire sequentially. Finally, N/M synchronous subclusters of M neurons were predicted using the intersection of parameters that supported both between-cluster splay and within-cluster synchrony. Surprisingly, the splay mode between clusters could enforce synchrony on subclusters that were incapable of synchronizing themselves. These results can be used to gain insights into the activity of networks of biological neurons whose PRCs can be measured.},

abstract = {Rat and mouse models are widely used for studies in cognition and pathophysiology, among others. Here, we sought to determine to what extent these two model species differ for cholinergic and cholinoceptive features. For this purpose, we focused on cholinergic innervation patterns based on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunostaining, and the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) detected immunocytochemically. In this brief review we first place cholinergic and cholinoceptive markers in a historic perspective, and then provide an overview of recent publications on cholinergic studies and techniques to provide a literature survey of current research. Next, we compare mouse (C57Bl/J6) and rat (Wistar) cholinergic and cholinoceptive systems simultaneously stained, respectively, for ChAT (analyzed qualitatively) and mAChRs (analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively). In general, the topographic cholinergic innervation patterns of both rodent species are highly comparable, with only considerable (but region specific) differences in number of detectable cholinergic interneurons, which are more numerous in rat. In contrast, immunolabeling for mAChRs, detected by the monoclonal antibody M35, differs markedly in the forebrain between the two species. In mouse brain, basal levels of activated and/or internalized mAChRs (as a consequence of cholinergic neurotransmission) are significantly higher. This suggests a higher cholinergic tone in mouse than rat, and hence the animal model of choice may have consequences for cholinergic drug testing experiments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) are thought to inversely correlate with cortical excitability. Goal-oriented modulation of alpha has been studied extensively. In visual spatial attention, alpha over the region of visual cortex corresponding to the attended location decreases, signifying increased excitability to facilitate the processing of impending stimuli. In contrast, in retention of verbal working memory, alpha over visual cortex increases, signifying decreased excitability to gate out stimulus input to protect the information held online from sensory interference. According to the prevailing model, this goal-oriented biasing of sensory cortex is effected by top-down control signals from frontal and parietal cortices. The present study tests and substantiates this hypothesis by (a) identifying the signals that mediate the top-down biasing influence, (b) examining whether the cortical areas issuing these signals are task-specific or task-independent, and (c) establishing the possible mechanism of the biasing action. High-density human EEG data were recorded in two experimental paradigms: a trial-by-trial cued visual spatial attention task and a modified Sternberg working memory task. Applying Granger causality to both sensor-level and source-level data we report the following findings. In covert visual spatial attention, the regions exerting top-down control over visual activity are lateralized to the right hemisphere, with the dipoles located at the right frontal eye field (FEF) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) being the main sources of top-down influences. During retention of verbal working memory, the regions exerting top-down control over visual activity are lateralized to the left hemisphere, with the dipoles located at the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) being the main source of top-down influences. In both experiments, top-down influences are mediated by alpha oscillations, and the biasing effect is likely achieved via an inhibition-disinhibition mechanism.},

abstract = {Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been suggested to constitute a highly flexible mechanism for cortical information gating and processing, giving rise to conscious perception and various higher cognitive functions in humans. In particular, it might provide an elegant tool for information integration across several spatiotemporal scales within nested or coupled neuronal networks. However, it is currently unknown whether low frequency (theta/alpha) or high frequency gamma oscillations orchestrate cross-frequency interactions, raising the question of who is master and who is slave. While correlative evidence suggested that at least two distinct CFC modes exist, namely phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC) and amplitude-envelope-correlations (AEC), it is currently unknown whether they subserve distinct cortical functions. Novel non-invasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), now provide the unique opportunity to selectively entrain the low or high frequency component and study subsequent effects on CFC. Here, we demonstrate the differential modulation of CFC during selective entrainment of alpha or gamma oscillations. Our results reveal that entrainment of the low frequency component increased PAC, where gamma power became preferentially locked to the trough of the alpha oscillation, while gamma-band entrainment reduced alpha power through enhanced AECs. These results provide causal evidence for the functional role of coupled alpha and gamma oscillations for visual processing.},

abstract = {In simulating realistic neuronal circuitry composed of diverse types of neurons, we need an elemental spiking neuron model that is capable of not only quantitatively reproducing spike times of biological neurons given in vivo-like fluctuating inputs, but also qualitatively representing a variety of firing responses to transient current inputs. Simplistic models based on leaky integrate-and-fire mechanisms have demonstrated the ability to adapt to biological neurons. In particular, the multi-timescale adaptive threshold (MAT) model reproduces and predicts precise spike times of regular-spiking, intrinsic-bursting, and fast-spiking neurons, under any fluctuating current; however, this model is incapable of reproducing such specific firing responses as inhibitory rebound spiking and resonate spiking. In this paper, we augment the MAT model by adding a voltage dependency term to the adaptive threshold so that the model can exhibit the full variety of firing responses to various transient current pulses while maintaining the high adaptability inherent in the original MAT model. Furthermore, with this addition, our model is actually able to better predict spike times. Despite the augmentation, the model has only four free parameters and is implementable in an efficient algorithm for large-scale simulation due to its linearity, serving as an element neuron model in the simulation of realistic neuronal circuitry.},

This was achieved by using a simple type of learning rule first derived by Girolami (1997) by choosing negentropy as a projection pursuit index. Parameterized probability distributions that have sub- and supergaussian regimes were used to derive a general learning rule that preserves the simple architecture proposed by Bell and Sejnowski (1995), is optimized using the natural gradient by Amari (1998), and uses the stability analysis of Cardoso and Laheld (1996) to switch between sub- and supergaussian regimes. We demonstrate that the extended infomax algorithm is able to separate 20 sources with a variety of source distributions easily. Applied to high-dimensional data from electroencephalographic recordings, it is effective at separating artifacts such as eye blinks and line noise from weaker electrical signals that arise from sources in the brain.},

abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study analytically the dynamics of a network of sparsely connected inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons in a regime where individual neurons emit spikes irregularly and at a low rate. In the limit when the number of neurons N → ∞, the network exhibits a sharp transition between a stationary and an oscillatory global activity regime where neurons are weakly synchronized. The activity becomes oscillatory when the inhibitory feedback is strong enough. The period of the global oscillation is found to be mainly controlled by synaptic times but depends also on the characteristics of the external input. In large but finite networks, the analysis shows that global oscillations of finite coherence time generically exist both above and below the critical inhibition threshold. Their characteristics are determined as functions of systems parameters in these two different regimes. The results are found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations.},

Several studies suggest that gamma band activity in primary visual cortex (V1) is produced in granular and superficial layers and is associated with the processing of visual input [1-3]. Oscillatory alpha band activity in deeper layers has been proposed to modulate neuronal excitability associated with changes in arousal and cognitive factors [4-7]. To investigate the layer-specific interplay between these two phenomena, we characterized the coupling between alpha and gamma band activity of the local field potential in V1 of the awake macaque. Using multicontact laminar electrodes to measure spontaneous signals simultaneously from all layers of V1, we found a robust coupling between alpha phase in the deeper layers and gamma amplitude in granular and superficial layers. Moreover, the power in the two frequency bands was anticorrelated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate robust interlaminar cross-frequency coupling in the visual cortex, supporting the view that neuronal activity in the alpha frequency range phasically modulates processing in the cortical microcircuit in a top-down manner [7]. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Rejecting contaminated trials causes substantial data loss, and restricting eye movements/blinks limits the experimental designs possible and may impact the cognitive processes under investigation. This article presents a method based on blind source separation (BSS) for automatic removal of electroocular artifacts from EEG data. BBS is a signal-processing methodology that includes independent component analysis (ICA). In contrast to previously explored ICA-based methods for artifact removal, this method is automated. Moreover, the BSS algorithm described herein can isolate correlated electroocular components with a high degree of accuracy. Although the focus is on eliminating ocular artifacts in EEG data, the approach can be extended to other sources of EEG contamination such as cardiac signals, environmental noise, and electrode drift, and adapted for use with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data, a magnetic correlate of EEG.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) receive feedforward input from the thalamus, which shapes receptive-field properties. They additionally receive recurrent inputs via horizontal connections within V1 and feedback from higher visual areas that are thought to be important for conscious visual perception. Here, we investigated what roles different glutamate receptors play in conveying feedforward and recurrent inputs in macaque V1. As a measure of recurrent processing, we used figure-ground modulation (FGM), the increased activity of neurons representing figures compared with background, which depends on feedback from higher areas. We found that feedforward-driven activity was strongly reduced by the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), whereas this drug had no effect on FGM. In contrast, blockers of the NMDA receptor reduced FGM, whereas their effect on visually driven activity varied with the subunit specificity of the drug. The NMDA receptor blocker 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) caused a slight reduction of the visual response, whereas ifenprodil, which targets NMDA receptors containing the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, increased the visual response. These findings demonstrate that glutamate receptors contribute differently to feedforward and recurrent processing in V1 and suggest ways to selectively disrupt recurrent processing so that its role in visual perception can be elucidated.},

This thesis, if true, serves cognitive psychology by constraining the space of computational-level theories of cognition. To utilize this constraint, a precise and workable definition of "computational tractability" is needed. Following computer science tradition, many cognitive scientists and psychologists define computational tractability as polynomial-time computability, leading to the P-Cognition thesis. This article explains how and why the P-Cognition thesis may be overly restrictive, risking the exclusion of veridical computational-level theories from scientific investigation. An argument is made to replace the P-Cognition thesis by the FPT-Cognition thesis as an alternative formalization of the Tractable Cognition thesis (here, FPT stands for fixed-parameter tractable).

abstract = {Multielectrode voltage data are usually recorded against a common reference. Such data are frequently used without further treatment to assess patterns of functional connectivity between neuronal populations and between brain areas. It is important to note from the outset that such an approach is valid only when the reference electrode is nearly electrically silent. In practice, however, the reference electrode is generally not electrically silent, thereby adding a common signal to the recorded data. Volume conduction further complicates the problem. In this study we demonstrate the adverse effects of common signals on the estimation of Granger causality, which is a statistical measure used to infer synaptic transmission and information flow in neural circuits from multielectrode data. We further test the hypothesis that the problem can be overcome by utilizing bipolar derivations where the difference between two nearby electrodes is taken and treated as a representation of local neural activity. Simulated data generated by a neuronal network model where the connectivity pattern is known were considered first. This was followed by analyzing data from three experimental preparations where a priori predictions regarding the patterns of causal interactions can be made: (1) laminar recordings from the hippocampus of an anesthetized rat during theta rhythm, (2) laminar recordings from V4 of an awake-behaving macaque monkey during alpha rhythm, and (3) ECoG recordings from electrode arrays implanted in the middle temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex of an epilepsy patient during fixation. For both simulation and experimental analysis the results show that bipolar derivations yield the expected connectivity patterns whereas the untreated data (referred to as unipolar signals) do not. In addition, current source density signals, where applicable, yield results that are close to the expected connectivity patterns, whereas the commonly practiced average re-reference method leads to erroneous results.},

abstract = {Neurons that exhibit a peak at finite frequency in their membrane potential response to oscillatory inputs are widespread in the nervous system. However, the influence of this subthreshold resonance on spiking properties has not yet been thoroughly analyzed. To this end, generalized integrate-and-fire models are introduced that reproduce at the linear level the subthreshold behavior of any given conductance-based model. A detailed analysis is presented of the simplest resonant model of this kind that has two variables: the membrane potential and a supplementary voltage-gated resonant variable. The firing-rate modulation created by a noisy weak oscillatory drive, mimicking an in vivo environment, is computed numerically and analytically when the dynamics of the resonant variable is slow compared to that of the membrane potential. The results show that the firing-rate modulation is shaped by the subthreshold resonance. For weak noise, the firing-rate modulation has a minimum near the preferred subthreshold frequency. For higher noise, such as that prevailing in vivo, the firing-rate modulation peaks near the preferred subthreshold frequency.},

abstract = {The integration of incoming experimental data into coherent models of the brain is an increasing challenge of modern neuroscience. Such models provide a bridge between structure and activity, and identify the mechanisms giving rise to experimental observations. Nevertheless, structurally realistic network models of spiking neurons are necessarily under-constrained even if experimental data on brain connectivity are incorporated to the best of our knowledge. Guided by physiological observations, any model must therefore explore the parameter ranges within the uncertainty of the data. Based on simulation results alone, however, the mechanisms underlying stable and physiologically realistic activity often remain obscure. We here employ a mean-field reduction of the dynamics, which allows us to include activity constraints into the process of model construction. We shape the phase space of a multi-scale network model of primate visual cortex by systematically refining its connectivity. Fundamental constraints on the activity, i.e., prohibiting quiescence and requiring global stability, prove sufficient to obtain realistic layer- and area-specific activity. Only minimal adaptations of the structure are required, showing that the network operates close to an instability. The procedure identifies components of the network critical to its collective dynamics and creates hypotheses for structural data and future experiments.},

It covers topics ranging from classical cellular biophysics and proceeding up to systems level neuroscience. Starting at an introductory mathematical level, presuming no more than calculus through elementary differential equations, the level will build up as increasingly complex techniques are introduced and combined with earlier ones. Each chapter includes a comprehensive series of exercises with solutions, taken from the set developed by the authors in their course lectures. MATLAB code is included for each computational figure, to allow the reader to reproduce them. Biographical notes referring the reader to more specialized literature and additional mathematical material that may be needed either to deepen the reader's understanding or to introduce basic concepts for less mathematically inclined readers completes each chapter.},

abstract = {There is a fundamental link between cholinergic neurotransmitter function and overt and covert actions. Major cholinergic systems include peripheral motor neurons organizing skeletal muscle movements into overt behaviors and cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and mesopontine regions that mediate covert actions realized as states of consciousness, arousal, selective attention, perception, and memory. Cholinergic interneurons in the striatum appear to integrate conscious and unconscious actions. Neural network models involving cholinergic neurons, as well as neurons using other neurotransmitters, emphasize connective circuitry as being responsible for both motor programs and neural correlates of higher consciousness. This, however, is only a partial description. At a more fundamental level lie intracellular mechanisms involving the cytoskeleton, which are common to both muscle contraction and neuroplastic responses in targets of central cholinergic cells attendant with higher cognition. Acetylcholine, acting through nicotinic receptors, triggers interactions between cytoskeletal proteins in skeletal muscle cells, as has been long known. There is also evidence that acetylcholine released at central sites acts through muscarinic and nicotinic receptors to initiate responses in actin and microtubule proteins. These effects and their implications for cholinergic involvement in higher cognition are explored in this review. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Field potential oscillations at approximately 10 Hz (alpha rhythm) are widely noted in the visual cortices, but their physiological mechanisms and significance are poorly understood. In vitro studies have implicated pyramidal neurons in both infragranular and supragranular layers as pacemakers. The generality of these observations for the intact brain in the behaving subject is unknown. We analyzed laminar profiles of spontaneous local field potentials and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from visual areas V2, V4, and inferotemporal (IT) cortex of two macaque monkeys during performance of a sensory discrimination task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and their potential for alpha pacemaking. The role of each alpha current generator was further delineated by Granger causality analyses. In V2 and V4, alpha current generators were found in all layers, with the infragranular generator acting as primary local pacemaking generator. In contrast, in IT, alpha current generators were found only in supragranular and infragranular layers, with the supragranular generator acting as primary local pacemaking generator. The amplitude of alpha activity in V2 and V4 was negatively correlated with behavioral performance, whereas the opposite was true in IT. The alpha rhythm in IT thus appears to differ from that in the lower-order cortices, both in terms of its underlying physiological mechanism and its behavioral correlates. This work may help to reconcile some of the diverse findings and conclusions on the functional significance of alpha band oscillations in the visual system.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of recurrent networks of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons in the presence of time-dependent inputs. The dynamics is characterized by the network dynamical transfer function, i.e., how the population firing rate is modulated by sinusoidal inputs at arbitrary frequencies. Two types of networks are studied and compared: (i) a Wilson-Cowan type firing rate model; and (ii) a fully connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, in a strong noise regime. We first characterize the region of stability of the "asynchronous state" (a state in which population activity is constant in time when external inputs are constant) in the space of parameters characterizing the connectivity of the network. We then systematically characterize the qualitative behaviors of the dynamical transfer function, as a function of the connectivity. We find that the transfer function can be either low-pass, or with a single or double resonance, depending on the connection strengths and synaptic time constants. Resonances appear when the system is close to Hopf bifurcations, that can be induced by two separate mechanisms: the I-I connectivity and the E-I connectivity. Double resonances can appear when excitatory delays are larger than inhibitory delays, due to the fact that two distinct instabilities exist with a finite gap between the corresponding frequencies. In networks of LIF neurons, changes in external inputs and external noise are shown to be able to change qualitatively the network transfer function. Firing rate models are shown to exhibit the same diversity of transfer functions as the LIF network, provided delays are present. They can also exhibit input-dependent changes of the transfer function, provided a suitable static non-linearity is incorporated.},

@article{Kimura1997,
abstract = {Simultaneous whole cell recordings from monosynaptically connected cortical cells were performed with the use of two patch pipettes to determine the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs, respectively) in cultured neurons from rat visual cortex. For 96{\%} of EPSPs and 73{\%} of IPSPs, ACh potently suppressed postsynaptic potentials in a dose-dependent manner. The estimated effective concentrations to produce half maximal response (EC50S) were 30 and 210 nM for EPSPs and IPSPs, respectively. To identify what subtypes of ACh receptors are involved in the suppression of postsynaptic potentials, three different, partially selective muscarinic receptor antagonists were used. According to the comparison of estimated Schild coefficients for each of the three antagonists against the suppression by ACh, EPSPs are most likely mediated by m4 receptors, and IPSPs by m1 receptors. When cells were treated with pertussis toxin, which inactivates m2 and m4 receptors while leaving m1, m3, and m5 receptors intact, 7 of 8 EPSPs were resistant to ACh whereas 8 of 12 IPSPs were still suppressed by ACh. This result supports the interpretation that the suppression of EPSPs was mediated by m4 receptors and that of IPSPs by m1 receptors. To obtain an indication as to whether ACh works presynaptically or postsynaptically, 1/CV2 analysis was carried out. The resultant diagonal alignment of the ratio of 1/CV2 plotted against the ratio of the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials suggests a presynaptic mechanism for the suppression of both EPSPs and IPSPs. In addition, in many cases a large synaptic suppression was observed without an obvious change in the input resistance. Furthermore, in one case where a single inhibitory driver cell was recorded with three different follower cells sequentially, none of the three IPSPs was suppressed by ACh, providing additional support for the presynaptic localization of ACh action. These results suggest that in cerebral cortex ACh has, in addition to its direct facilitatory effect via m3 pharmacology, a suppressive effect on EPSPs and IPSPs via m1 and m4 muscarinic receptors, respectively, probably with a presynaptic site of action. Separation of the actions of ACh into different receptor-second messenger pathways with potential for independent interactions with other neuromodulatory systems may be an important aspect of the mechanism of cholinergic regulation of functional state in cortex. Separation of cholinergic effects at different receptors might also offer a means for selective pharmacological intervention in disorders of sleep or memory.},

abstract = {Attention to a stimulus enhances both neuronal responses and gamma frequency synchrony in visual area V4, both of which should increase the impact of attended information on downstream neurons. To determine whether gamma synchrony is common throughout the ventral stream, we recorded from neurons in the superficial and deep layers of V1, V2, and V4 in two rhesus monkeys. We found an unexpected striking difference in gamma synchrony in the superficial vs. deep layers. In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40-60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers, whereas the deep layers showed maximal coherence at low frequencies (6-16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers. The results suggest that synchrony plays very different roles in feedback and feedforward projections.},

In this review, new findings, integrating across rodent models and human imaging are highlighted that have yielded new insights towards a basic understanding of the disorder. In particular, this review focuses on cortical-subcortical interactions underlying the pathophysiology of MDD. In particular, evidence is accruing that dysfunction in prefrontal-subcortical circuits including the amygdala, ventral striatum (VS), hippocampus and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are associated with MDD status.},

The power of high frequency ({\textgreater}30 Hz) oscillations in LFPs is locked to the phase of low frequency ({\textless}30 Hz) oscillations, an effect known as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). While PAC has been observed in a variety of cortical regions and animal models, its functional role particularly in primate visual cortex is largely unknown. Here, we document PAC for LFPs recorded from extra-striate area MT of macaque monkeys, an area specialized for the processing of visual motion. We further show that directing spatial attention into the receptive field of MT neurons decreases the coupling between the low frequency phase and high frequency power of LFPs. This attentional suppression of PAC increases neuronal discriminability for attended visual stimuli. Therefore, we hypothesize that visual cortex uses PAC to regulate inter-neuronal correlations and thereby enhances the coding of relevant stimuli.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) and blind source separation (BSS) methods are increasingly used to separate individual brain and non-brain source signals mixed by volume conduction in electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological recordings. We compared results of decomposing thirteen 71-channel human scalp EEG datasets by 22 ICA and BSS algorithms, assessing the pairwise mutual information (PMI) in scalp channel pairs, the remaining PMI in component pairs, the overall mutual information reduction (MIR) effected by each decomposition, and decomposition 'dipolarity' defined as the number of component scalp maps matching the projection of a single equivalent dipole with less than a given residual variance. The least well-performing algorithm was principal component analysis (PCA); best performing were AMICA and other likelihood/mutual information based ICA methods. Though these and other commonly-used decomposition methods returned many similar components, across 18 ICA/BSS algorithms mean dipolarity varied linearly with both MIR and with PMI remaining between the resulting component time courses, a result compatible with an interpretation of many maximally independent EEG components as being volume-conducted projections of partially-synchronous local cortical field activity within single compact cortical domains. To encourage further method comparisons, the data and software used to prepare the results have been made available (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BSSComparison).},

@article{Bollimunta2011a,
abstract = {Field potential oscillations in the ∼10 Hz range are known as the alpha rhythm. The genesis and function of alpha has been the subject of intense investigation for the past 80 years. Whereas early work focused on the thalamus as the pacemaker of alpha rhythm, subsequent slice studies revealed that pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of sensory cortices are capable of oscillating in the alpha frequency range independently. How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular, and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG. There is also indication that alpha oscillations in the lateral geniculate cohere with those in V1.},

abstract = {The brain continuously adapts its processing machinery to behavioural demands. To achieve this, it rapidly modulates the operating mode of cortical circuits, controlling the way that information is transformed and routed. This article will focus on two experimental approaches by which the control of cortical information processing has been investigated: the study of state-dependent cortical processing in rodents and attention in the primate visual system. Both processes involve a modulation of low-frequency activity fluctuations and spiking correlation, and are mediated by common receptor systems. We suggest that selective attention involves processes that are similar to state change, and that operate at a local columnar level to enhance the representation of otherwise non-salient features while suppressing internally generated activity patterns.},

The layer- and population-resolved network connectivity integrates axonal tracing data from the CoCoMac database with recent quantitative tracing data, and is systematically refined using dynamical constraints. Simulations reveal a stable asynchronous irregular ground state with heterogeneous activity across areas, layers, and populations. Elicited by large-scale interactions, the model reproduces longer intrinsic time scales in higher compared to early visual areas. Activity propagates down the visual hierarchy, similar to experimental results associated with visual imagery. Cortico-cortical interaction patterns agree well with fMRI resting-state functional connectivity. The model bridges the gap between local and large-scale accounts of cortex, and clarifies how the detailed connectivity of cortex shapes its dynamics on multiple scales.},

abstract = {Mapping the flow of activity through neocortical microcircuits provides key insights into the underlying circuit architecture. Using a comparative analysis we determined the extent to which the dynamics of microcircuits in mouse primary somatosensory barrel field (S1BF) and auditory (A1) neocortex generalize. We imaged the simultaneous dynamics of up to 1126 neurons spanning multiple columns and layers using high-speed multiphoton imaging. The temporal progression and reliability of reactivation of circuit events in both regions suggested common underlying cortical design features. We used circuit activity flow to generate functional connectivity maps, or graphs, to test the microcircuit hypothesis within a functional framework. S1BF and A1 present a useful test of the postulate as both regions map sensory input anatomically, but each area appears organized according to different design principles. We projected the functional topologies into anatomical space and found benchmarks of organization that had been previously described using physiology and anatomical methods, consistent with a close mapping between anatomy and functional dynamics. By comparing graphs representing activity flow we found that each region is similarly organized as highlighted by hallmarks of small world, scale free, and hierarchical modular topologies. Models of prototypical functional circuits from each area of cortex were sufficient to recapitulate experimentally observed circuit activity. Convergence to common behavior by these models was accomplished using preferential attachment to scale from an auditory up to a somatosensory circuit. These functional data imply that the microcircuit hypothesis be framed as scalable principles of neocortical circuit design.},

abstract = {The dynamics of networks of sparsely connected excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons are studied analytically. The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed},

As a result, it changes the state of neuronal networks throughout the brain and modifies their response to internal and external inputs: the classical role of a neuromodulator. Here, we identify actions of cholinergic signaling on cellular and synaptic properties of neurons in several brain areas and discuss consequences of this signaling on behaviors related to drug abuse, attention, food intake, and affect. The diverse effects of acetylcholine depend on site of release, receptor subtypes, and target neuronal population; however, a common theme is that acetylcholine potentiates behaviors that are adaptive to environmental stimuli and decreases responses to ongoing stimuli that do not require immediate action. The ability of acetylcholine to coordinate the response of neuronal networks in many brain areas makes cholinergic modulation an essential mechanism underlying complex behaviors.},

It is believed that correlations are a consequence of shared inputs between nearby neurons and could severely constrain information decoding. Here we show theoretically that recurrent neural networks can generate an asynchronous state characterized by arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts of shared input. In this state, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other, generating negative correlations in synaptic currents which cancel the effect of shared input. Near-zero mean correlations were seen experimentally in recordings from rodent neocortex in vivo. Our results suggest a reexamination of the sources underlying observed correlations and their functional consequences for information processing.},

abstract = {Modeling synaptic transmission between neurons is a challenging task. Since many physiological processes contribute to synaptic transmission (figure 6.1), computa- tional models require numerous simplifications and abstractions. Furthermore, since synapses change their properties on many time scales, synaptic transmission is also a highly dynamic process. In addition, synaptic transmission is stochastic and believed to be an important source of noise in the nervous system. Finally, because the num- ber of synapses in any decent-sized network is large (chapter 13), e‰cient simulation routines are important. The human brain is estimated to contain some 1014 synapses. Even if all synapses were identical, modeling them would present a substantial computational challenge. Moreover, synaptic connections in the central nervous system are highly diverse. This diversity is not simply due to random variability, but most likely reflects a highly specified and precise design. For example, the same presynaptic axon can give rise to synapses with di¤erent properties, depending on the type of the postsynaptic target neuron (Thomson et al., 1993; Thomson, 1997; Reyes et al., 1998; Markram et al., 1998). At the same time, synapses on a given postsynaptic dendrite can have dif- ferent properties, depending on their dendritic location and the identity of the pre- synaptic neuron (Walker et al., 2002). Moreover, synaptic e‰cacies are not static but have activity-dependent dynamics in the form of short-term (Zucker and Regehr, 2002) and long-term plasticity (Abbott and Nelson, 2000), which are the consequence of complex molecular net- works. Simulation of synaptic transmission therefore requires careful simplifications. This chapter describes models at di¤erent levels of realism and computational e‰- ciency for simulating synapses and their plasticity. We also review experimental data that provide the parameter values for the synapse models, focusing on the dom- inant transmitter and receptor types mediating fast synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system.},

abstract = {Dendritic integration of synaptic signals is likely to be an important process by which nerve cells encode synaptic input into spike output. However, the response properties of dendrites to time-varying inputs are largely unknown. Here, I determine the transfer impedance of the apical dendrite in layer V pyramidal cells by dual whole cell patch-clamp recordings in slices of rat somatosensory cortex. Sinusoidal current waveforms of linearly changing frequencies (0.1-25 Hz) were alternately injected into the soma or apical dendrite and the resulting voltage oscillations recorded by the second electrode. Dendrosomatic and somatodendritic transfer impedances were calculated by Fourier analysis. At near physiological temperatures (T approximately 35 degrees C), the transfer impedance had a maximal magnitude at low frequencies (f(res) approximately 6 Hz). In addition, voltage led current up to approximately 3 Hz, followed by a current lead over voltage at higher frequencies. Thus the transfer impedance of the apical dendrite is characterized by a low-frequency resonance. The frequency of the resonance was voltage dependent, and its strength increased with dendritic distance. The resonance was completely abolished by the I(h) channel blocker ZD 7288. Dendrosomatic and somatodendritic transfer properties of the apical dendrite were independent of direction or amplitude of the input current, and the responses of individual versus distributed inputs were additive, thus implying linearity. For just threshold current injections, action potentials were generated preferentially at the resonating frequency. I conclude that due to the interplay of a sag current (I(h)) with the membrane capacitance, layer V pyramids can act as linear band-pass filters with a frequency preference in the theta frequency band.},

abstract = {The neocortex has a high capacity for plasticity. To understand the full scope of this capacity, it is essential to know how neurons choose particular partners to form synaptic connections. By using multineuron whole-cell recordings and confocal microscopy we found that axons of layer V neocortical pyramidal neurons do not preferentially project toward the dendrites of particular neighboring pyramidal neurons; instead, axons promiscuously touch all neighboring dendrites without any bias. Functional synaptic coupling of a small fraction of these neurons is, however, correlated with the existence of synaptic boutons at existing touch sites. These data provide the first direct experimental evidence for a tabula rasa-like structural matrix between neocortical pyramidal neurons and suggests that pre- and postsynaptic interactions shape the conversion between touches and synapses to form specific functional microcircuits. These data also indicate that the local neocortical microcircuit has the potential to be differently rewired without the need for remodeling axonal or dendritic arbors.},
