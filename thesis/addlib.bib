abstract = {The novel wake-promoting agent modafinil has been in use for the treatment of several sleep disorders for a few years and is now undergoing clinical trials for its use in the treatment of stimulant addiction, but its primary mechanism of action remains elusive. Previous laboratory studies have shown that modafinil has antioxidative and neuroprotective effects, which have not previously been suggested to be related to its wake-promoting effects. However, recent research indicates that free radicals may be related to sleep induction as well as cellular damage, suggesting that a common target of action may mediate modafinil's ability to oppose both of these effects. In this review we summarize and discuss previously published research on modafinil's neural, cytoprotective, and cognitive effects, and we propose possible primary biochemical targets that could underlie the effects of modafinil observed in these studies. We also suggest neurocognitive mechanisms responsible for modafinil's cognitive enhancing effects and its therapeutic potential in the treatment of stimulant addiction.},

abstract = {In relaxed wakefulness, the EEG exhibits robust rhythms in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), which decelerate to theta (approximately 2-7 Hz) frequencies during early sleep. In animal models, these rhythms occur coherently with synchronized activity in the thalamus. However, the mechanisms of this thalamic activity are unknown. Here we show that, in slices of the lateral geniculate nucleus maintained in vitro, activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mGluR1a induces synchronized oscillations at alpha and theta frequencies that share similarities with thalamic alpha and theta rhythms recorded in vivo. These in vitro oscillations are driven by an unusual form of burst firing that is present in a subset of thalamocortical neurons and are synchronized by gap junctions. We propose that mGluR1a-induced oscillations are a potential mechanism whereby the thalamus promotes EEG alpha and theta rhythms in the intact brain.},

abstract = {Thalamocortical projections were studied in adult cats using biotinylated dextran amines, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and autoradiography with tritiated leucine and/or proline. The input from 7 architectonically defined nuclei to 14 auditory cortical fields was characterized qualitatively and quantitatively. The principal results were that 1) every thalamic nucleus projected to more than 1 field (range, 4-14 fields; mean, 7 fields); 2) only the projection from the ventral division to some primary fields (primary auditory cortex and posterior auditory cortex) had a periodic, clustered distribution, whereas the input from other divisions to nonprimary areas was continuous; 3) layers III-V received {\textgreater}85{\%} of the total axonal profiles; 4) in most experiments, five or more layers were labeled; 5) the projections to nonprimary auditory areas had many laterally oriented axons; 6) the heaviest input to layer I in all experiments was usually in its upper half, suggesting a sublaminar arrangement; 7) the largest axonal trunks (up to 6 microm in diameter) arose from the medial division and ended in layer Ia, where they ran laterally for long distances; 8) there were three projection patterns: type 1 had its peak in layers III-IV with little input to layer I, and it arose from the ventral division and the dorsal superficial, dorsal, and suprageniculate nuclei of the dorsal division; type 2 had heavy labeling in layer I and less in layers III-IV, arising from the dorsal division nuclei primarily, especially the caudal dorsal and deep dorsal nuclei; and type 3 was a trimodal concentration in layers I, III-IV, and VI that originated chiefly in the medial division and had the lowest density of labeling; and 9) the quantitative profiles with the three methods were very similar. The results suggest that the subdivisions of the auditory thalamus have consistent patterns of laminar distribution to different cortical areas, that an average of five or more layers receive significant input in a specific area, that a given thalamic nucleus can influence areas as far as 20 mm apart, that the first information to arrive at the cortex may reach layer I by virtue of the giant axons, and that several laminar patterns of auditory thalamocortical projection exist. The view that the auditory thalamus (and perhaps other thalamic nuclei) serves mainly a relay function underestimates its many modes for influencing the cortex on a laminar basis.},

abstract = {The majority of thalamic terminals in V1 arise from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferents. Thalamic afferent terminals are preferentially labeled by an isoform of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2. The goal of our study was to determine the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in macaque and human visual cortex. First, we investigated the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in all layers of macaque monkey primary visual cortex (V1), and found a very close correspondence between the known distribution of LGN afferents from previous studies and the distribution of VGluT2-immunoreactive (-ir) puncta. There was also a close correspondence between cytochrome oxidase density and VGluT2-ir puncta distribution. After validating the correspondence in macaque, we made a comparative study in human V1. In many aspects, the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in human was qualitatively similar to that of the macaque: high densities in layer 4C, patches of VGluT2-ir puncta in the supragranular layer (2/3), lower but clear distribution in layers 1 and 6, and very few puncta in layers 5 and 4B. However, there were also important differences between macaques and humans. In layer 4A of human, there was a sparse distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta, whereas in macaque, there was a dense distribution with the characteristic honeycomb organization. The results suggest important changes in the pattern of cortical VGluT2 immunostaining that may be related to evolutionary differences in the cortical organization of LGN afferents between Old World monkeys and humans.},

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, and delta responses to events are, just as the gamma band, strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in functional communication in the brain in relation to memory and integrative functions.},

This review summarizes the recent evidence that synchronous neural oscillations reveal much about the origin and nature of cognitive processes such as memory, attention and consciousness. Memory processes are most closely related to theta and gamma rhythms, whereas attention seems closely associated with alpha and gamma rhythms. Conscious awareness may arise from synchronous neural oscillations occurring globally throughout the brain rather than from the locally synchronous oscillations that occur when a sensory area encodes a stimulus. These associations between the dynamics of the brain and cognitive processes indicate progress towards a unified theory of brain and cognition.},

Neurons in primary visual cortex respond to visual stimuli with a Poisson distributed spike train with an appropriate, stimulus-dependent mean firing rate. The firing rate of neurons whose receptive fields overlap with the “focus of attention” is modulated with a periodic function in the 40 Hz range, such that their mean firing rate is identical to the mean firing rate of neurons in “non-attended” areas. This modulation is detected by inhibitory interneurons in V4 and is used to suppress the response of V4 cells associated with non-attended visual stimuli. Using very simple single-cell models, we obtain quantitative agreement with Moran and Desimone's (1985) experiments.},

By contrast, ventrobasal (VB) thalamic stimulation, while activating the reticular and basal ganglia nuclei, also activated directly layers 4 and deep 5 of the cortex. Conjoined stimulation of the VB and CL nuclei resulted in supralinear summation of the two inputs at cortical output layer 5, demonstrating coincidence detection along the apical dendrites. This supralinear summation was also noticed at gamma band stimulus frequency ( approximately 40 Hz). Direct stimulation of cortical layer 1, after a radial section of the cortex that spared only that layer, was shown to sum supralinearly with the cortical activation triggered by VB stimulation, providing a second demonstration for coincidence detection. Coincidence detection by coactivation of the specific (VB) and nonspecific (CL) thalamic nuclei has been proposed as the basis for the temporal conjunction that supports cognitive binding in the brain.},

abstract = {Cortical activity and perception are not driven by the external stimulus alone; rather sensory information has to be integrated with various other internal constraints such as expectations, recent memories, planned actions, etc. The question is how large scale integration over many remote and size-varying processes might be performed by the brain. We have conducted a series of EEG recordings during processes thought to involve neuronal assemblies of varying complexity. While local synchronization during visual processing evolved in the gamma frequency range, synchronization between neighboring temporal and parietal cortex during multimodal semantic processing evolved in a lower, the beta1 (12-18 Hz) frequency range, and long range fronto-parietal interactions during working memory retention and mental imagery evolved in the theta and alpha (4-8 Hz, 8-12 Hz) frequency range. Thus, a relationship seems to exist between the extent of functional integration and the synchronization-frequency. In particular, long-range interactions in the alpha and theta ranges seem specifically involved in processing of internal mental context, i.e. for top-down processing. We propose that large scale integration is performed by synchronization among neurons and neuronal assemblies evolving in different frequency ranges. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {A large-scale computer model was constructed to gain insight into the structural basis for the generation of fast synchronous rhythms (20-60 Hz) in the thalamocortical system. The model consisted of 65,000 spiking neurons organized topographically to represent sectors of a primary and secondary area of mammalian visual cortex, and two associated regions of the dorsal thalamus and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, were organized in supragranular layers, infraganular layers and layer IV. Reciprocal intra- and interlaminar, interareal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and thalamoreticular connections were set up based on known anatomical constraints. Simulations of neuronal responses to visual input revealed sporadic epochs of synchronous oscillations involving all levels of the model, similar to the fast rhythms recorded in vivo. By systematically modifying physiological and structural parameters in the model, specific network properties were found to play a major role in the generation of this rhythmic activity. For example, fast synchronous rhythms could be sustained autonomously by lateral and interlaminar interactions within and among local cortical circuits. In addition, these oscillations were propagated to the thalamus and amplified by corticothalamocortical loops, including the thalamic reticular complex. Finally, synchronous oscillations were differentially affected by lesioning forward and backward interareal connections.},

Microelectrode recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and fMRI has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCH) induces oscillations in the delta (CCH-delta), theta (CCH-theta), and gamma (CCH-gamma) frequency ranges in the hippocampal slice preparation, eliciting asynchronous CCH-theta, synchronous CCH-delta, and synchronous CCH-theta with increasing CCH concentration (Fellous and Seinowski, Hippocampus 2000;1 0:187-197). In a network model of area CA3, the time scale for CCH-delta corresponded to the decay constant of the gating variable of the calcium-dependent potassium (K-AHP) current, that of CCH-theta to an intrinsic subthreshold membrane potential oscillation of the pyramidal cells, and that of CCH-gamma to the decay constant of GABAergic inhibitory synaptic potentials onto the pyramidal cells. In model simulations, the known physiological effects of carbachol on the muscarinic and K-AHP currents, and on the strengths of excitatory postsynaptic potentials, reproduced transitions from asynchronous CCH-theta to CCH-delta and from CCH-delta to synchronous CCH-theta. The simulations also exhibited the interspersed CCH-gamma/CCH-delta and CCH-gamma/CCH-theta that were observed in experiments. The model, in addition, predicted an oscillatory state with all three frequency bands present, which has not yet been observed experimentally.},

@incollection{Singer1999,
abstract = {In the cerebral cortex two complementary strategies are applied for the representation of perceptual objects: the generation of highly specific neurons that respond to complex conjunctions of elementary features and the dynamic formation of coherent assemblies of cells, whereby each cell codes only for particular aspects of the perceptual object. The second strategy requires that neurons convey two messages in parallel: first, whether the feature constellation to which they are tuned is present and, second, with which of the other neurons they cooperate to form an assembly. Evidence suggests that the presence of the respective feature constellation is signaled by an increase in discharge rate while the relations with other neurons are established by precise synchronization of action potentials. This requires context-dependent dynamic adjustment of spike timing. The oscillatory patterning of neuronal responses that occurs in different frequency bands and in most structures in the brain is proposed to serve this adjustment and to provide the basis for the generation and read-out of temporal codes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Helmer2015,
abstract = {The role played by interlayer connections in shaping local responses and their long-range coupling has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we analyze a rate model of a canonic local circuit with realistic anatomy. We find that this circuit generates a rich repertoire of possible dynamical states, including an oscillatory regime in which gammaand beta-oscillations dominate in superficial and deep layers, respectively, in agreement with experimental observations. This regime stems from non-linear inter-layer interactions, independently from intrinsic resonance properties of distinct layers. Moreover, by connecting two local circuits via cortico-cortical projections, the emergent phase differences define a flexible and frequency-dependent inter-areal hierarchy. Such dynamic patterns generally do not arise in randomized circuits, and the compatible connectomes are rare, although not unique. Altogether, these results suggest that inter-layer connectivity is homeostatically regulated to make local circuits fit to integrate and multiplex signals from several sources in multiple frequency bands.},

@techreport{Mejias,
abstract = {Interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes in the cerebral cortex hold the key to understanding predictive coding, executive control and a gamut of other brain functions. The underlying circuit mechanism, however, remains poorly understood and represents a major challenge in neuroscience. In the present work we tackled this problem using a large-scale computational model of the primate cortex constrained by new directed and weighted connectivity data. In our model, the interplay between feedforward and feedback signaling depends on the cortical laminar structure and involves complex dynamics across multiple (intra-laminar, inter-laminar, inter-areal and whole cortex) scales. The model was tested by reproducing, and shedding insights into, a wide range of neurophysiological findings about frequency-dependent interactions between visual cortical areas: feedforward pathways are associated with enhanced gamma (30-70 Hz) oscillations, whereas feedback projections selectively modulate alpha/low beta (8-15 Hz) oscillations. We found that in order for the model to account for the experimental observations, the feedback projection needs to predominantly target infragranular layers in a target area, which leads to a proposed circuit substrate for predictive coding. The model reproduces a functional hierarchy based on frequency-dependent Granger causality analysis of inter-areal signaling, as reported in recent monkey and human experiments. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of multi-scale approaches and provides a modeling platform for studies of large-scale brain circuit dynamics and functions.},

@article{Gray1989,
abstract = {In areas 17 and 18 of the cat visual cortex the firing probability of neurons, in response to the presentation of optimally aligned light bars within their receptive field, oscillates with a peak frequency near 40 Hz. The neuronal firing pattern is tightly correlated with the phase and amplitude of an oscillatory local field potential recorded through the same electrode. The amplitude of the local field-potential oscillations are maximal in response to stimuli that match the orientation and direction preference of the local cluster of neurons. Single and multiunit recordings from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus showed no evidence of oscillations of the neuronal firing probability in the range of 20-70 Hz. The results demonstrate that local neuronal populations in the visual cortex engage in stimulus-specific synchronous oscillations resulting from an intracortical mechanism. The oscillatory responses may provide a general mechanism by which activity patterns in spatially separate regions of the cortex are temporally coordinated.},

@article{Chen2016a,
abstract = {Oscillatory networks often include neurons that membrane potential resonance, a peak in the voltage amplitude as a function of current input at a nonzero (resonance) frequency (fres). Although fres has been correlated to the network frequency (fnet) in a variety of systems, a causal relationship between the two has not been established. We examine the hypothesis that combinations of biophysical parameters that shift fres, without changing other attributes of the impedance profile, also shift fnet in the same direction. We test this hypothesis, computationally and experimentally, in an electrically coupled network consisting of intrinsically oscillatory (O) and resonator (R) neurons. Using a two-cell model of such a network, we show increasing fres of R directly increases fnet and that this effect becomes more prominent if the amplitude of resonance is increased. Notably, the effect of fres on fnet is independent of the parameters that define the oscillator, or the combination of parameters in R that produce the shift in fres, so long as this combination produces the same impedance vs. frequency relationship. We experimentally verify the model predictions, using the dynamic clamp technique, by connecting a model resonator to the pacemaker PD neurons of the crab Cancer borealis pyloric network, using electrical synapses, and show that the pyloric network frequency can be shifted by changing fres in the resonator. Our results provide compelling evidence that resonance frequency and amplitude strongly influence the network oscillation frequency and therefore modulators may target these attributes in order to modify rhythmic activity.},

@article{White1995,
abstract = {The conditions under which a noninactivating sodium current and either a potassium current or an inwardly rectifying cation current can generate subthreshold oscillations were analyzed using nonlinear dynamical techniques applied to a neuronal model consisting of two differential equations. Mathematical descriptions of the membrane currents were derived using voltage-clamp data collected from entorhinal cortical neurons. A bifurcation analysis was performed using applied current as the control parameter to map the range of magnitudes of the sodium, potassium/cation, and leakage conductances over which subthreshold oscillations exist. The threshold of the potassium/cation current was an important determinant of the robustness of oscillatory behavior. The activation time constant of the potassium/cation current largely determined the frequency range of emergent oscillations. This result implicates the slow inward rectifier or an as yet undescribed slow outward current in entorhinal cortical oscillations; the latter explanation, while more speculative, is more consistent with the pharmacological properties of subthreshold oscillations and gives oscillations over a larger current range. The shallowness of the sodium activation curve confined emergent oscillations to rise gradually rather than abruptly and extended the current range over which the model oscillated.},

@article{Schmidt2016,
abstract = {Cortical oscillations modulate cellular excitability and facilitate neuronal communication and information processing. Layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5 PYs) drive low-frequency oscillations ({\textless}4 Hz) in neocortical networks in vivo. In vitro, individual L5 PYs exhibit subthreshold resonance in the theta band (4-8 Hz). This bandpass filtering of periodic input is mediated by h-current (Ih) and m-current (IM) that selectively suppress low-frequency input. It has remained unclear how these intrinsic properties of cells contribute to the emergent, network oscillation dynamics. To begin to close this gap, we studied the link between cellular and network mechanisms of network resonance driven by L5 PYs. We performed multielectrode array recordings of network activity in slices of medial prefrontal cortex from the Thy1-ChR2-eYFP line and activated the network by temporally patterned optogenetic suprathreshold stimulation. Networks driven by stimulation of L5 PYs exhibited resonance in the theta band. We found that Ih and IM play a role in resonant suprathreshold network response to depolarizing stimuli. The action of Ih in mediating resonance was dependent on synaptic transmission while that of IM was not. These results demonstrate how synergistic interaction of synaptic and intrinsic ion channels contribute to the response of networks driven by L5 PYs.},

@misc{Silva1991,
abstract = {Rhythmic activity in the neocortex varies with different behavioral and pathological states and in some cases may encode sensory information. However, the neural mechanisms of these oscillations are largely unknown. Many pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex showed prolonged, 5- to 12-hertz rhythmic firing patterns at threshold. Rhythmic firing was due to intrinsic membrane properties, sodium conductances were essential for rhythmicity, and calcium-dependent conductances strongly modified rhythmicity. Isolated slices of neocortex generated epochs of 4- to 10-hertz synchronized activity when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated channels were facilitated. Layer 5 was both necessary and sufficient to produce these synchronized oscillations. Thus, synaptic networks of intrinsically rhythmic neurons in layer 5 may generate or promote certain synchronized oscillations of the neocortex.},
